I suggest following structure:

1. Introduction (you are missing numbering for the intro chapter)
- Motivation
- Objectives

2. Background and related work
- Semantic Web
- Linked Data
- LOD and DBpedia
**** you are missing here: NLP and NIF and also related works

3. Analysis and Implementation
* you need to describe here the: 1) requirements, 2) design and 3) implementation

4. Testing

5. Conclusions
- Future work
