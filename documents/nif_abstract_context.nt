<http://dbpedia.org/resource/!!!?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "!!! ( chk-chk-chk) is an American dance-punk band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1995 by lead singer Nic Offer. Members of !!! came from other local bands such as the Yah Mos, Black Liquorice and Pope Smashers. They are currently based in New York City. The band's eighth album, Wallop, was released in August 2019.\n\nBackground and history\n!!! is an American band formed in the summer of 1995 by the merger of part of the group Black Liquorice and Popesmashers. After a successful joint tour, the two teams decided to mix the disco-funk with more aggressive sounds and integrate the hardcore singer Nic Offer from the Yah Mos. The band's name was inspired by the subtitles of the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy, in which the clicking sounds of the Bushmen's Khoisan language were represented as \"!\". However, as the bandmembers themselves say, !!! is pronounced by repeating thrice any monosyllabic sound. \"Chk Chk Chk\" is the most common pronunciation, and the URL of their official website and the title of their Myspace page suggest it is the preferred pronunciation. The band's full-length debut record came out in 2000 as a self-titled album on the label Gold Standard Laboratories. This was followed in 2003 by the single \"Me and Giuliani Down By the School Yard\", a lengthy track combining house beats with sinewy basslines, psychedelic guitars, and simple lyrics which quote the title song of the musical Footloose. A second full-length, Louden Up Now, was released on Touch and Go in America and on Warp Records in Europe in June 2004. In June 2005 !!! released a new EP covering \"Take Ecstasy with Me\" by The Magnetic Fields, and \"Get Up\" by Nate Dogg. The following December, the original drummer for the band, Mikel Gius, was struck and killed by a car while riding his bike. They released their third album, Myth Takes in 2007. !!! is composed of Mario Andreoni (guitar), Dan Gorman (horns/percussion/keys), Nic Offer (vocals), Tyler Pope (bass/various electronic devices), and Allan Wilson (horns/percussion/keys). Touring members include Shannon Funchess (vocals) and Paul Quattrone (drums). The band also shared membership with the similar, defunct group Out Hud (including Tyler Pope, who has played with LCD Soundsystem and written music for Cake). Vocalist and drummer John Pugh officially left the band in July 2007 to concentrate on his new band Free Blood.Shannon Funchess stood in for Pugh during much of their 2007 tour.\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAlbums\n\n\nEPs\n\n* GSL26/LAB SERIES VOL. 2 (Split with Out Hud, 1999, Gold Standard Labs) \n* Live Live Live (November 2004, Beat Records, Japan only) \n* Take Ecstasy with Me/Get Up (June 7, 2005, Touch and Go Records) \n* Yadnus (2007) \n* Jamie, My Intentions Are Bass E.P.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/!Action_Pact!?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "!Action Pact! was a London-based punk rock band, formed in 1981 by guitarist Wild Planet, bassist , singer , and drummer .\n\nHistory\n!Action Pact! was from Stanwell in Middlesex, and was also originally named Bad Samaritans. In 1981 they changed their name to !Action Pact!. The John from Dead Mans Shadow (D.M.S.) was Bad Samaritan's original lead singer, and he left to concentrate on D.M.S., before the name change. He was replaced by George Cheex, who got the job because of \"her courage to scream along with the band's songs.\" They contributed two songs to the EP Heathrow Touchdown which was released in October, 1981, while George and Joe were still only 15 years old. \"London Bouncers\" and \"All Purpose Action Footwear\", got the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. He played their songs often and he convinced the band to record their first full session, which they did on 22 February 1982. They recorded \"People\", \"Suicide Bag\", \"Mindless Aggression\", \"Losers\", and \"Cowslick Blues\". The resulting demo tape caught the attention of the fledgling label Fall Out Records, which signed the band as the first act on its roster. !Action Pact!'s label debut, the Suicide Bag EP, was released in July 1982 and rocketed to the top of the British punk chart. The band would later be joined by drummer Grimly Fiendish and bassist Thistles, and producer Phil Langham would also moonlight on bass under the name Elvin Pelvin; whereas Kim Igoe, the bassist, continued on as a lyricist. The band split in 1986. In early 2016, Wild Planet (Des Stanley) died from cancer.\n\nOther projects\nWild Planet managed the heavy rock band Purge, in which his son, Mark Stanley, plays bass guitar; Purge has sometimes played a live cover version of !Action Pact!'s \"London Bouncers\". Joe Fungus also played with the punk band called Savage Upsurge.\n\nDiscography\nChart positions shown are from the UK Indie Chart.\n\nAlbums\n\n\nSingles/EPs\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (2015). \"Action Pact Biography\". facebook.

It is based on the question, \"What if Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?\". After the original tour in 2003 ended, it was released on DVD, CD, and was written into a trilogy of novels and series of comic books.\n\nPlot\n!HERO is a rock opera modernizing Jesus's last two years of life, as described in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City, in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations (ICON). Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N., nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out, except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently, New York City is a police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small, isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions, only Judaism survives and flourishes, at least, as much as it can. In Bethlehem, PA, a child named Jesus, but referred to as HERO, is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City, teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes HERO is a threat, and the Chief of police Devlin (a derivative of the Devil or Satan), with the help of chief Rabbi Kai (Caiaphas), conspire to end HERO's revolutionary teachings. The Opera is narrated by \"Agent Hunter\", a former I.C.O.N. agent who met HERO and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov (Peter), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), and Jude (Judas Iscariot) the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray HERO. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus' miracles and sermons, using references from the Bible's four gospels, continues through Jesus' execution, at the hands of I.C.O.N's angry mob, and eventually ending with his resurrection.\n\nRecording cast\n\n* Michael Tait as Jesus/HERO \n* Mark Stuart of Audio Adrenaline as Petrov \n* Rebecca St. James as Maggie \n* Paul Wright as Special Agent Hunter \n* Donnie Lewis as Mama Mary \n* Billy Buchanan as Chief Rabbi Kai \n* Michael Quinlan as Jude \n* Shannon Bain as Blind Cripple \n* T-Bone as Jairus \n* Donnie Lewis as Jairus' Wife \n* Shannon Bain as Police Chief Devlin \n* Bob Farrell as Governor Pilate \n* John Grey as Preacher Rabbi at the wedding \n* Nathan Lee as Janitor Angel \n* GRITS as the Wedding Party \n* Pete and Donna Stewart as the bride and groom at the wedding\n\nSong list\n(See also: !Hero (album))\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (2004). \"Hero: The Rock Opera: Full Cast & Crew\".

The mid-nineteenth century experienced migration as a result of the protracted frontier wars that forced the movement of certain indigenous groups further north of the Cape Colony. These included the Khoisan, the Basters (a derogatory term for people of mixed European and Khoi heritage) and the !Kora, a people whom the colonial authorities considered more of a bandit community. The !Kora were known to loot communities living around the lower to middle Orange River. The raids increased in volume and intensity during the mid eighteen hundreds. This forced the authorities to launch a series of expeditions aimed at countering the raids. The !Kora were finally stopped in 1879, but their intimate knowledge of the Gariep (Orange River) rendered them the most significant threat to settler colonies outside of the Bantu nations at the time.\n\nOrigins\nRecent studies has come to consider the !Kora people as more of a loose group of communities. Initially they consisted of two groupings, the Little Korana and the Great Korana. Movement and divisions would come to separate them into even smaller groups. Some of these differences were caused by quarrels over grazing rights, livestock and water sources. The !Ikora were a nomadic people, who were not bound to any one place for long stretches of time, even then they were considered to be semi-pastoral communities. Many of them shunned life in the Cape Colony because it meant living a life of servitude and hard labour. Instead, they looked northwards for a free life. Their ability to use guns and ride horses effectively were skills adopted under colonial life and these were skills that would prove beneficial to their cause. This made them highly adept at raiding livestock belonging to colonial settler communities.\n\nLife along the Gariep\nMany groups within the !Kora community lived all along the expansive Orange River. They became highly knowledgeable of it and used its islands and riverbanks to their advantage. During this time the banks of the Orange were dense with foliage and reeds. On the river itself were numerous islands dotted about, which revealed themselves when water levels were low. The combination of tall reeds and the islands provided an advantage for the !Kora, because they were able to ambush their targets much easier.\n\nThe legend of Stuurman\nIn the 1830s the sparse settler communities along the Orange River region were able to counter some of the raids from the !Kora people, however a highly skilled and organised group of !Kora marauders began to emerge. A former slave known as Stuurman who belonged to a family in Griqualand led this group. Little is recorded on his ancestry. With a growing number of disgruntled! !Kora under his leadership, he gained notoriety 1832 when he and his followers stole livestock on cattle farms south of the Orange River. It is reported that they stole 5 wagons, 3000 sheep, 70 horses and 200 head of cattle. Over the next two years they proceeded to loot the border towns of Clanwilliam, Beaufort West and Graaf Reinet. These were areas leading out of the Cape Colony; policing presence in these areas was scattered. Stuurman also launched attacks on the Tswana of Griqualand. Stuurman was however shot and killed by a white cattle farmer.\n\nOutlaws\nThe 1860s in Southern Africa brought about a serious drought, which had a profound impact on the movement of the Bantu communities; the trekbroers who were beginning to concentrate on a life in the interior; and the Khoi and San communities that were being forced further north by the latter's migration. The communities around the Orange River were beginning to grow in their numbers, a reality that some !Kora leaders took full advantage of. The most notorious leaders of this time were Klaas Springbokke of the Springbokke group, Klaas Lukas of the Cat Korana group, with Cupido Pofadder occupying the more westerly region of the Orange River. These fractured groups put a lot of roving Trekboers and Bastaard communities under pressure, with their cattle being a prime target. Some of !Kora were also rumoured to have secured smuggling networks further in the interior that could supply them with arms. Jan Kivido and Piet Rooi formed a partnership and were the most consistent raiders.\n\nConflict\nThe first recorded significant incident between the !Kora people and the colonial government occurred in 1869, when a Griqua and Scottish trader were robbed along the southern bank of the Orange River. Piet Rooi, the leader of another nomadic !Kora group, was held responsible for the robbery, and as punishment was lashed and committed to three months hard labour. He was subsequently released on account of insufficient evidence against him. The treatment he received did not sit well with many of the !Ikora raiders, and this spurred them into increased levels of livestock pillaging that belonged to the settlers throughout the region. A three hundred-man strong commando under Special Magistrate Maxmillian Jackson was deployed to try and deal with Rooi and Kivido's activities, and although Kivido was killed in the insurgence, the attack was considered a failure as the commando struggled to navigate the islands due to limited understanding of the river's layout. As a result, the efforts to deter the !Kora from any more raids were increased. The authorities bribed two leaders of the most powerful groups, Lukas and Cupido Pofadder. They were given protection in exchange for information on the other marauding groups. Lukas orchestrated the recapture of Rooi and some of his cohorts, and handed them over to the Special Magistrate, and about 400 men were sentenced to Robben Island.\n\nAftermath\nThose who were able to evade capture retreated into the Kalahari Desert. Some among the captured !Kora were forced back into manual labour on white farms, while others succumbed to smallpox. In effect, the entire !Kora community was destroyed, and some of their prominent lead raiders spent decades behind bars. By the time they were released, they were too old and frail to resume their activities, and the !Kora people were too scattered to mobilise once more.\n\nSee also\n\n* Mfecane \n* Hendrik Witbooi\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (2016). \"Kora\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/!Kung_languages?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "!Kung IPA: [!ʊŋ] (!Xun), also known as Ju, is a dialect continuum (language complex) spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and Angola by the ǃKung people, constituting two or three languages. Together with the ǂʼAmkoe language, !Kung forms the Kxʼa language family. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family, and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless, the anthropological term \"Khoisan\" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general. !Kung is famous for its many clicks, such as the ǃ in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone. For a description, see Juǀʼhoan. To pronounce !Xuun (pronounced [!͡χũː˦˥] in Western !Kung/!Xuun) one makes a click sound before the x sound (which is like a Scottish or German ch), followed by a long nasal u vowel with a high rising tone.\n\nNames\nThe term !Kung, or variants thereof, is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute a single language; Ju tends to be used when considering them as a small language family. !Kung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects, as opposed to the well documented Ju|ʼhoan dialects in the south(east); however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves !Kung. The spellings !Xun and !Xuun seen in recent literature are related to the Ju|ʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu(u)n in the 1975 orthography, or ǃKu(u)n in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu, ǃKhung, ǃKu, Kung, Qxü, ǃung, ǃXo, Xû, ǃXû, Xun, ǃXung, ǃXũũ, !Xun, ʗhũ:, and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu, Juu, Zhu.\n\nSpeakers\nIf the !Kung dialects are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous !Kung variety, Juǀʼhoan, is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary, but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but Brenzinger (2011) counts 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975). Until the mid–late twentieth century, the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most !Kung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia (primarily to the Caprivi Strip), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War, more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than a decade living in precarious conditions, the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for a permanent settlement at Platfontein, near Schmidtsdrift. Only Ju|'hoan is written, and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both.\n\nVarieties\nThe better-known !Kung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan, Ekoka !Kung, ǃʼOǃKung, and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects, but the boundaries are unclear. There is a clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast, but also a diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine & Honken (2010) classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider a single language: \n* Northern–Western !XunNorthern !Xun(N1) Maligo (!xuun, kúándò !xuun \"Kwando !Xuun\"; SE Angola)(N2) ǃʼOǃKung (!ʼo !uŋ \"Forest !Xuun\"; eastern C Angola)Western !Xun(W1) — (!xūún, !ʼālè !xòān \"Valley !Xuun\"; Eenhana district, N Namibia)(W2) ǀʼAkhwe (!xūún, ǀʼākhòè !xòān \"Kwanyama !Xuun\"; Eenhana, N Namibia)(W3) Tsintsabis (!xūún; Tsintsabis, Tsumeb district, N Namibia)(K) Kavango !Xuun (!xūún, known as dom !xūún \"River !Xuun\" in Ekoka; Western Rundu district, N Namibia, & Angola adjacent) \n* Central !Xun(C1) Gaub (Tsumeb district, N Namibia)(C2) Neitsas (Grootfontein district, N Namibia)tentatively also the Tsintsabis, Leeunes and Mangetti (different from Mangetti Dune) dialects \n* Southeastern !Xun(E1) Juǀʼhoan (ju-|ʼhoan(-si); Tsumkwe district, N Namibia, & Bots adjacent)(E2) Dikundu (!xun, ju-|ʼhoa(si); Dikundu, W Caprivi)(E3) ǂKxʼauǁʼein (ju-|ʼhoan(-si), !xun, ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn \"Northern people\"; Gobabis district, E Namibia) Heine & König (2015.324) state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects \"understand one another to quite some extent\" but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands (2010) classifies !Kung dialects into four clusters, with the first two being quite close: \n* Northern !Kung: Southern Angola, around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers, but with many refugees now in Namibia:ǃʼOǃKungMaligo \n* North-Central !Kung: Namibia, between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border, around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan:TsintsabisOkongoOvamboMpunguvleiǀʼAkhwe (Ekoka) \n* Central !Kung: The area around Grootfontein, Namibia, west of the central  and south of the  \n* Southeastern !Kung: Botswana east of the Okavango Delta, and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu, Gobabis, and the Caprivi Strip:TsumkweOmatakoKameeldoringEpukiro. ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time.\n\nProtolanguage\nThe ancestral language, Proto-Juu or Proto-!Xuun, had five places of click articulation: Dental, alveolar, palatal, alveolar lateral, and retroflex (*‼). The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan, but remain in Central !Kung. In ǀʼAkhwe (Ekoka), the palatal click has become a fricated alveolar.\n\nNotes\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Brenzinger, Matthias (2011).

(an acronym for \"The Obliteration of Humanity\") is a progressive death metal band from the Czech Republic formed in 1990. Early in their career, the band's lyrics focused mainly on gore, but in recent years they have focused a lot more on politics and social matters.\n\nHistory\nThe band was founded under the name Devastator by brothers Jan and Josef Veselý in 1990, changing its name to !T.O.O.H.! in 1993. Jan and Josef go by the pseudonyms \"Schizoid\" and \"Humanoid\" respectively. The band split up shortly after finishing the Řád a trest album due to financial difficulties, after being dropped by Earache Records, who took the album out of print two months after its release. In September 2011, the band reformed as a duo. In 2013, they released their fourth album, Democratic Solution, for free via their Facebook page. Democratic Solution was musically very different from their previous recordings; the band retained its progressive death metal/grindcore characteristics and complex song structures, but instead of an instrumental background, the album featured electronic instrumentation and effects, electronic drums, clean vocals and ample use of keyboards throughout compositions. The resulting sound was closer to the brothers' other project, §§.Critical reception of this album was divided, with some reviewers considering it as one of the band's worst, and some as one of their best works. During this time the duo went public with news of Humanoid's mental health problems, as he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during the recording of Democratic Solution. The band performed their last show on 16 February 2013 in Ostrava, and the following day they announced their disbandment due to difficulties playing live, stating that \"it is for him [Humanoid] too stressful\" and that \"to continue as a studio project would be pointless\". However, on April 1, 2017 the duo announced via their Facebook page that they had been working on new material and planned to release an album sometime in 2018. They added that they had laid the groundwork for three songs already, which would be in a more traditional deathgrind style, unlike the band's previous album which featured an experimental and electronic take on grind. The duo said the new material would \"sound like proper deathgrind with pompous passages\" and \"we want to go into a professional studio, where we are going to record live acoustic drums and loud guitars, and thus ensure dynamic sound quality\". They also confirmed that they would continue to not play live shows, due to Humanoid's illness, with Schizoid saying that \"we do not plan to play live, as Jose's [Humanoid's] diagnosis doesn't allow it\".\n\nMembers\n\n* Jan \"Schizoid\" Veselý - vocals, drums (1990-2005; 2011-2013; 2017-) \n* Josef \"Humanoid\" Veselý - vocals, guitar (1990-2005; 2011-2013; 2017-)\n\nFormer members\n\n* Pavel \"Android\" Slavíček - bass guitar (1996-1998) \n* Petr \"Wokis\" Vokál - guitar (2004-2005) (also in Duobetic Homunkulus) \n* Petr \"Freedom\" Svoboda - bass guitar (2004-2005)\n\nTimeline\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Vy kusy mrdacího masa (\"You Pieces of Fucking Flesh\") demo (1995) \n* Sen to není, nesmí (\"It's Not, Can't Be a Dream\") demo (1997) \n* Live in Prosek demo (1998) \n* Z vyšší vůle (\"From Higher Will\") (2000) \n* Pod vládou biče (\"Under the Reign of the Whip\") (2002) \n* Řád a trest (\"Order and Punishment\") (2005) \n* Democratic Solution (2013)\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (2017). \"!T.O.O.H.!\". sputnikmusic.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/!Women_Art_Revolution?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "!Women Art Revolution is a 2010 documentary film directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson and distributed by Zeitgeist Films. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists, curators, critics, and historians.\n\nSynopsis\n!Women Art Revolution is a documentary film, created by Lynn Hershman Leeson, to examine the under-recognized world of feminist art. Through interviews, documentary footage, and artworks, the film tracks the trajectory of feminist art. It begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests, it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s. Lynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result. The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists; very few can name more than Frida Khalo. Hershman calls the film the, \"remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told.\" She says the events of the day led her to feel an, \"urgency to capture that moment\" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera. The film gets its name from Women Artists in Revolution (WAR), which formed in the 1960s as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time. The film overlays historical events with feminist art events, which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the Vietnam War, Black Panthers, Civil Rights Movement, Women's Liberation, and Free Speech Movement. She labels the 1968 Miss America Pageant as the moment when art and politics fused, culminating in a weeklong protest of art events. The film mentions that minimalism was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics, this movement didn't match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues, creating a platform for awareness of these events.\n\nCast\n\n\nAwards\n\n* 2010: Official Selection at Toronto International Film Festival \n* 2011: Official Selection at Sundance Film Festival, New Frontier \n* 2011: Official Selection at Berlin International Film Festival\n\nRelease\nThe film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category. !Women Art Revolution played at New York's IFC Center beginning June 1, 2011, before opening around the country.\n\nDigital archive\nIn the film, Hershman states that the filming process, \"has accumulated (roughly) 12,428 minutes of footage,\" and !W.A.R. shows only 83 minutes, leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out. A digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson's interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the Stanford University Libraries collection, !W.A.R. Voices of a Movement. According to the collection website, Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to \"be shared with as wide an audience as possible.\"\n\nReception\nBarry Keith Grant praises the film in his Film International piece, \"Leeson's film is a like a patchwork quilt of disparate footage, but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today.\" Reviewer Ellen Druda says, \"This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman's heart. Not only art lovers will come away with a deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way.\" Richard Knight for the Windy City Times has a more critical view of the film, explaining, \"Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own - just like those 'womyn only' coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day.' So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries - and annoyingly overlooks the artists feminist forebears (like O'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) - !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone.\" Elisabeth Subrin states that, \"Fusing history with memoir, Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion.\"\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (2018). \"Artist, Curator & Critic Interviews\". !Women Art Revolution - Spotlight at Stanford.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/!Wowow!?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "!Wowow! is a collective in Peckham, London. Otherwise known as The Children of !Wowow!, they are a group of artists, fashion designers, writers and musicians, who have promoted numerous art events and parties in London and Berlin.\n\nHistory\n!Wowow! began in the back of the Joiners Arms in Camberwell in 2003 as a performance night in a pub by Hanna Hanra and Matthew Stone. In 2004, the collective squatted a large Victorian co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an artist-run space. They include fashion designer Gareth Pugh, performance artist Millie Brown, video installation artist Adham Faramawy, James Balmforth and artist Matthew Stone. Other artists to have shown in the space include Boo Saville, Gareth Cadwallader, and Ellie Tobin. In 2003, !Wowow! organised warehouse parties in Peckham. At times club nights with 2000 people took place. One of these was attended by Lauren Bush, the former U.S. President's niece, and her two CIA bodyguards. The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings, film, photography and performance by recent Slade graduates for a month in the Georgian building at 251 Rye Lane, Peckham, formerly occupied by the Co-op shop, which the artists gutted and refurbished. The artists, who curated the exhibition together, included Chloe Dewe Mathews with photographs of lidos, Matthew Stone with digital recreations of old paintings, Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and biro drawings. The opening featured shamanistic chanting, a shopping Trolley Mardi Gras, live bands and a recreation of Michael Jackson's video Thriller by performance artist Lali Chetwynd's troupe. In November 2005, the Children of !Wowow! organised a week-long event in a large warehouse in Peckham, curated by member Gareth Cadwallader, and in a number of smaller venues in the area, featuring members of the collective and also Mark McGowan. Events included Stolen Cinema with cult films from a local rental shop, Richard Elms' play Factory Dog, and a Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown. he week culminated with a party for 1,500 people, with 10,000 bottles of beer, 500 bottles of whiskey, and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew, Ludes, The Long Blondes, and Ivich Lives. The Amazing squat created its own \"distinctly odd harlequin-esque fashion style\", through Gareth Pughs' participation. Hanna Hanra and Katie Shillingford edited Fashion/ Art/ Leisure, a fanzine affiliated with the group. Matthew Stone said: It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in, rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns. The practicalities of not having to work meant that we could be playful with what we did, but some serious ideas came out of that ridiculous house. Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006, they have organised events in Dresden and also squatted a Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and Adham Faramawy have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham. Along with the original group, several other artists and performers exhibited, including Theo Adams, , Lennie Lee, and Fayann Smith.\n\nSee also\n\n* Artist collective \n* Lyndhurst Way\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon (May 8, 2007). \"Peckham art squats\".

(The Song Formerly Known As)\" is a song by Australian rock band Regurgitator. The song was released as a double-A sided single with \"Modern Life\" in September 1998 as the fourth and final single from the band's second studio album Unit. The single peaked at number 28 in Australia and it also ranked at number 6 on Triple J's Hottest 100 in 1998, with the single's bonus track \"I Like Your Old Remix Better Than Your New Remix\" being ranked at number 27. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, the song was nominated for two awards; ARIA Award for Best Group and ARIA Award for Single of the Year. In 2014, Clem Bastow from The Guardian said \"'!' is unmatched: it's a towering slab of electronic fuzz, tailor made for giant stadiums and the sort of raves that bring to mind The Matrix's Zion scenes, and yet the song is about staying home and listening to records in the living room with your significant other.\" In 2015, the song was listed at number 60 in In the Mix's 100 Greatest Australian Dance Tracks of All Time with Nick Jarvis saying \"The best track on the album (and arguably the best track the 'Gurge has written yet) – a dance track played by a live band about how dancing around your living room with bae wearing ugly pants is so much better than going out to loud, smoky clubs.\". In 2019, Tyler Jenke from The Brag ranked Regurgitator's best songs, with \"!\" coming it at number 1. Jenke said \"Ask anyone from the era, and they'll all agree that '! (The Song Formerly Known As)' is Regurgitator's finest moment.. it managed to become their shining glory, with lyrics that describe just sitting back and avoiding clubs, raves, and concerts in favour of a comfy lounge room in suburbia.\" calling the song \"an essential piece of Aussie music history.\"\n\nTrack listings\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nRelease history\n\n\nReferences\n" .

(pronounced “Exclamation Mark”) is the second studio album by American rapper and singer Trippie Redd, released on August 9, 2019. The album features appearances from Diplo, The Game, Lil Duke, Lil Baby, and Coi Leray.\n\nBackground\nIn January 2019, Trippie Redd announced that he had two more projects to be released soon in an Instagram live stream, his second studio album, Immortal and Mobile Suit Pussy, which was reportedly set to be his fourth commercial mixtape, but it then became scrapped. He explained that Immortal would have tracks where deep and romantic concepts are present, while Mobile Suit Pussy would have contained tracks that are \"bangers\". Later in March 2019 in another Instagram live stream, Redd stated that his second album had \"shifted and changed\" and was no longer titled Immortal. He later revealed that the album would be titled !, and inspired by former collaborator XXXTentacion's ? album. Trippie released the lead single to the album \"Under Enemy Arms\" on May 29, 2019. He confirmed in an interview with Zane Lowe of Beats 1 Radio that the album would be titled ! and was already completed, but that he wanted to add several more features as well as videos. Playboi Carti was removed off his album.\n\nCritical reception\nRachel Aroesti of The Guardian described the album as \"compelling but contradictory emo-rap\", noting lyrical contradictions and concluding it \"is doubtless part of the genre's forward march – but it's hard to get past the sense that White has sacrificed a coherent artistic identity in the name of progress.\" Writing for Pitchfork, Andy O'Connor wrote that the \"songs touch on being true to oneself at all costs, but these half-baked lessons land flat since Redd himself doesn't really have an identity, musical or otherwise\", further commenting, \"Most of what happens here couldn't even realistically be considered rapping\", calling the verses \"dull and unimaginative on top of being restrictive in form\" and \"nonsense bars\". O'Connor concluded that \"the most enjoyable moments feel like controlled chaos. Redd [...] does at least sound more composed. That's to his credit as a person but it's not to his advantage as an artist.\"\n\nCommercial performance\n! debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with 51,000 album-equivalent units, of which 7,000 were pure album sales.\n\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted from Apple Music. Notes \n* \"They Afraid of You\" featuring Playboi Carti was removed from the album (including physical), except on Soundcloud.\n\nCharts\n\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$1,000_genome?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The $1,000 genome refers to an era of predictive and personalized medicine during which the cost of fully sequencing an individual's genome (WGS) is roughly one thousand USD. It is also the title of a book by British science writer and founding editor of Nature Genetics, Kevin Davies. By late 2015, the cost to generate a high-quality 'draft' whole human genome sequence was just below $1,500.\n\nHistory\nThe \"$1,000 genome\" catchphrase was first publicly recorded in December 2001 at a scientific retreat to discuss the future of biomedical research following publication of the first draft of the Human Genome Project (HGP), convened by the National Human Genome Research Institute at Airlie House in Virginia. The phrase neatly highlighted the chasm between the actual cost of the Human Genome Project, estimated at $2.7 billion over a decade, and the benchmark for routine, affordable personal genome sequencing. On 2 October 2002, Craig Venter introduced the opening session of GSAC (The Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference) at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston: \"The Future of Sequencing: Advancing Towards the $1,000 Genome.\" Speakers included George M. Church and executives from 454 Life Sciences, Solexa, U.S. Genomics, VisiGen and Amersham plc. In 2003, Venter announced that his foundation would earmark $500,000 for a breakthrough leading to the $1,000 genome. That sum was subsequently rolled into the Archon X Prize. In October 2004, NHGRI introduced the first in a series of '$1,000 Genome' grants designed to advance \"the development of breakthrough technologies that will enable a human-sized genome to be sequenced for $1,000 or less.\" In a January 2006 article in Scientific American making the case for the Personal Genome Project, George M. Church wrote The \"$1,000 genome\" has become shorthand for the promise of DNA-sequencing capability made so affordable that individuals might think the once-in-a-lifetime expenditure to have a full personal genome sequence read to a disk for doctors to reference is worthwhile. In 2007, the journal Nature Genetics invited dozens of scientists to respond to its 'Question of the Year': The sequencing of the equivalent of an entire human genome for $1,000 has been announced as a goal for the genetics community... What would you do if [the $1,000 genome was] available immediately? In May 2007, during a ceremony held at Baylor College of Medicine, 454 Life Sciences founder Jonathan Rothberg presented James D. Watson with a digital copy of his personal genome sequence on a portable hard drive. Rothberg estimated the cost of the sequence—the first personal genome produced using a next-generation sequencing platform—at $1 million. Watson's genome sequence was published in 2008. A number of scientists have highlighted the cost of additional analysis after performing sequencing. Bruce Korf, past president of the American College of Medical Genetics, described \"the $1-million interpretation.\" Washington University's Elaine Mardis prefers \"the $100,000 analysis.\"\n\nCommercial efforts\nAt the end of 2007, the biotech company Knome debuted the first direct-to-consumer genome sequencing service at an initial price of $350,000 (including analysis). One of the first clients was Dan Stoicescu, a Swiss-based biotech entrepreneur. As the costs of sequencing continued to plummet, in 2008, Illumina announced that it had sequenced an individual genome for $100,000 in reagent costs. Applied Biosystems countered by saying the cost on its platform was $60,000. Pacific Biosciences became the latest entrant in what The New York Times called \"a heated race for the '$1,000 genome'\". In 2009, Stanford University professor Stephen Quake published a paper sequencing his own genome on an instrument built by Helicos Biosciences (a company he co-founded) for a reported cost in consumables of $48,000. That same year, Complete Genomics debuted its proprietary whole-genome sequencing service for researchers, charging as little as $5,000/genome for bulk orders. In 2010, Illumina introduced its individual genome sequencing service for consumers, who were required to present a doctor's note. The initial price was $50,000/person. One of the first clients was former Solexa CEO John West, who had his entire family of four sequenced. In January 2012, Life Technologies unveiled a new sequencing instrument, the Ion Proton Sequencer, which it said would achieve the $1,000 genome in a day within 12 months. Sharon Begley wrote: \"After years of predictions that the '$1,000 genome' – a read-out of a person's complete genetic information for about the cost of a dental crown—was just around the corner, a U.S. company is announcing... that it has achieved that milestone.\" In January 2014, Illumina launched its HiSeq X Ten Sequencer, claiming to have produced the first $1,000 genome at 30× coverage. Some researchers hailed the HiSeq X Ten's release as a milestone – Michael Schatz of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said that \"it is a major human accomplishment on par with the development of the telescope or the microprocessor\". However, critics pointed out that the $10 million upfront investment required to purchase the system would deter customers. Furthermore, the $1,000 genome cost calculation left out overheads, such as the cost of powering the machine. In September 2015, Veritas Genetics (co-founded by George Church) announced $1,000 full-genome sequencing including interpretation for participants in the Personal Genome Project. In April 2017, the newly formed European company Dante Labs started offering the WGS for $900. In 2017, Beijing Genomics Institute began offering WGS for $600. In July 2018, on Amazon Prime Day, Dante Labs offered it for $349. In November 2018, around the time of Black Friday, Dante Labs offered WGS for the first time less than $200, and Veritas Genetics for two days for the same price of $199 offered WGS limited to a thousand customers. In March of the same year, geneticist Matthew Hurles of Wellcome Sanger Institute noted that the private companies, including Illumina, are currently competing to reach a new target for WGS of only $100.\n\nArchon Genomics X PRIZE\nIt was originally announced that the revamped Archon Genomics X PRIZE presented by Medco would hold a $10-million grand prize competition in January 2013 for the team that reaches (or comes closest to reaching) the $1,000 genome. The grand prize would go to \"the team(s) able to sequence 100 human genomes within 30 days to an accuracy of 1 error per 1,000,000 bases, with 98% completeness, identification of insertions, deletions and rearrangements, and a complete haplotype, at an audited total cost of $1,000 per genome.\" In August 2013 the Archon Genomics X PRIZE was cancelled, as the founders felt it had been \"Outpaced by Innovation,\" and \"was not incentivizing the technological changes\".\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Misha Angrist.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$100,000_Fortune_Hunt?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The $100,000 Fortune Hunt is an Illinois Lottery game show which debuted on September 16, 1989, and aired on Saturday evenings from 1989-1994 on WGN-TV in Chicago (except for 1 year in 1993 when it aired on WBBM-TV); it was also broadcast on WGN's national satellite feed. Jeff Coopwood hosted the first season, with the rest of the run being hosted by Mike Jackson. Linda Kollmeyer served as the hostess during the entire run with Bill Barber as the announcer.\n\nGameplay\nPotential contestants purchased a $100,000 Fortune Hunt scratch-off ticket from an Illinois Lottery retailer. To play the $100,000 Fortune Hunt players had to rub off the play area on the lottery instant ticket. If three matching prize amounts were revealed, the player won the prize shown–such as a free ticket or up to $100. If three TV symbols appeared, players could submit the ticket to the lottery for a preliminary drawing. This drawing was held every week in Springfield. At this first stage each week, six on-air contestants and 12 at-home viewers were selected from the preliminary drawing of entry tickets and asked to participate in the $100,000 Fortune Hunt. Only the first six contestants would appear on the TV show and have the opportunity to win the grand prize or other prizes. Two of the 12 at-home viewers were assigned to each of the six on-air contestants as partners. While one of the six who appeared on the game show won the grand prize, his or her two home \"partners\" would win $500 each. Each of the remaining five on-air contestants would receive at least $1,000, and their partners would receive $100. During the TV show, the six contestants would face a game board with 36 numbered panels. Each panel would reveal a plus or minus dollar amount (scores could never go below zero); players would try to accumulate the most money by randomly selecting panels. There would be special panels such as bankrupt, lose a turn, wipeout, and double. The player who collects the highest prize amount after five rounds was declared the winner and received the $100,000 grand prize. The other contestants, one at a time, would then be given a choice to keep their total winnings or trade them for a choice of prizes (hidden behind 12 numbered panels). These ranged from cash amounts totaling between $1,000 and $10,000 to merchandise such as rooms of furniture, trips, a big screen television, a camcorder combo, and many others. These rules only lasted the first seven months the show was on the air. Afterwards, the losing contestants got to keep whatever money they earned in the game, with a minimum of $1,500 if they didn't have that much. At the end of each show, hostess Kollmeyer drew six tickets at random from a revolving drum. The players who purchased those tickets were selected as the contestants for the next show. Other spaces included: \n* Bankrupt – The player who selected this lost his or her entire score; this space was signified by a dollar sign in a no symbol. \n* Double – If the player uncovered a Double space, he or she immediately picked another number off the game board, winning double the amount revealed (if the player uncovered a minus dollar amount, they lost that amount of money and no more); this space was signified by a red star with the word DOUBLE written across it in capital letters. \n* Lose a Turn – The player who selected this earned no money in that round; this space was signified by a sad face with the words \"Lose a Turn\" written at the bottom, which was later changed to the word TURN in a no symbol. \n* Free Turn – The player who selected this earned a Free Turn token which he or she could redeem at any time for an additional selection from the board. \n* Decision – The player who selected this could accept a prize (a brand new car in the first three rounds, and a luxury trip in the last two rounds) and resign from the game or pass on the prize and continue; this space was signified by a red star with a question mark over it (later in the run, this was changed to the word CAR or TRIP). Eventually, the trip was restricted to the consolation game, leaving the car the only prize offered in the main game. \n* 1/2 Car – This spaced replaced \"Decision\" later in the run. This space was signified by the front of the car in the first three rounds, and the back of the car in the last two rounds; players had to find both the front and back halves in order to choose to claim the car or pass it up and continue (just like with \"Decision\"). \n* Wipeout – If the player selected it, they were eliminated from the game and left with only $1,000; the space was signified by a sad face. This space was removed after the first four episodes and was replaced with the \"Lose a Turn\" space as described above. At the end of the game, the player in the lead won the $100,000. During the final season, the winner returned the following Saturday for up to five weeks. If the game ended in a tie, another round was played with the tied players, with the bigger dollar amount winning the game and the jackpot.\n\nBonus play\nOn April 14, 1990, a new scratch-ticket was introduced with a new home-player rule. Each contestant would be designated with a letter from A-F from left to right. Later on, the contestants were also given letters from G-L, again from left to right. At the end of the show, home viewers would be given a chance to win $100 playing the at-home Bonus Play game. The winning contestant spun a wheel with 10 spaces numbered 0-9. The winning number would consist of the $100,000 winner's letter(s) followed by a 4-digit number which the studio contestant created with four spins of the Bonus Play wheel. Any home viewer whose Bonus Play ticket number matched the contestant's letter and the 4 digits in the order they were spun would win $100. All Bonus Play tickets were good to last forever, so home viewers could keep them for the next drawing whether they were winners or not. Sometime in the show's second season, the home player element was dropped from the show altogether.\n\nNotes\nAfter the show's cancellation in 1994, Kollmeyer carried over to the show's successor, Illinois Instant Riches, alongside Mark Goodman. The pair also hosted that program's revamp in 1998, Illinois' Luckiest.\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$100,000_infield?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The $100,000 infield was the infield of the Philadelphia Athletics in the early 1910s. The $100,000 infield consisted of first baseman Stuffy McInnis, second baseman Eddie Collins, shortstop Jack Barry and third baseman Frank \"Home Run\" Baker. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the nickname reflects \"the purported combined market value of the foursome,\" which is equivalent to about $2.7 million in 2019. Baseball historian Bill James rated the 1914 edition of the $100,000 infield the greatest infield of all time, and also ranked the 1912 and 1913 editions in the top five all time. The $100,000 infield helped the Athletics win four American League championships in five years—1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914—and win the World Series in 1910, 1911 and 1913. The group was broken up after losing the 1914 World Series as a result of the financial pressures resulting from the emergence of the Federal League. Two members—Collins and Baker—have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nEddie Collins\nCollins was the first member of the $100,000 infield to join the Athletics. He debuted on September 17, 1906, after playing college ball at Columbia University. In 1906 and 1907, he played 20 games for the Athletics, mostly at shortstop. In 1908, he took over as the Athletics' regular second baseman, replacing Danny Murphy, who moved to the outfield. During the $100,000 infield years from 1910 to 1914, he played 738 games, getting 922 hits in 2,677 at bats for a batting average of .344. He led the American League in runs in 1912, 1913 and 1914, stolen bases in 1910, singles in 1913 and times on base in 1914. He also finished in the top ten in the American League in batting average, on-base percentage, hits, stolen bases, singles and times on base every year from 1910 through 1914. In addition, he finished in the top ten in American Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1914. He was sold to the Chicago White Sox after the 1914 season as Athletics' manager Connie Mack attempted to respond to the financial pressures brought on by the newly formed Federal League, breaking up the $100,000 infield. He returned to Mack and the Athletics in 1927, finishing his career playing 12 games for the Athletics in their 1929 and 1930 World Championship seasons. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1939.\n\nJack Barry\nBarry was the next to join the Athletics, debuting on July 13, 1908, after playing for the College of the Holy Cross. Between 1910 and 1914, Barry played 686 games for the Athletics, getting 607 hits in 2,334 at bats for a batting average of .260. He finished in the American League top ten in sacrifice hits every year from 1911 through 1914, and ranked fifth in the American League in runs batted in in 1913. But his primary contributions were on defense, where he had a strong arm, enormous range and sure hands, and was able to work out innovative plays with his good friend Collins, such as a defense against the double steal. He finished in the top 20 in Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, with his best showing a ninth-place finish in 1913. He was sold to the Boston Red Sox in the middle of the 1915 season, where he moved to second base and played on the Red Sox' 1915 and 1916 World Championship teams. He missed the Red Sox 1918 Championship season due to service in the U.S. Navy.\n\nFrank \"Home Run\" Baker\nBaker also joined the Athletics in 1908, debuting on September 21. He became the Athletics regular third baseman in 1909, and led the American League in triples that season. Between 1910 and 1914, Baker played 742 games for the Athletics, getting 929 hits in 2,864 at bats for a batting average of .324. He led the American League in home runs every year from 1911 through 1914, and led the league in runs batted in during 1912 and 1913. He also finished in the top ten in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and times on base every year from 1911 through 1914, and finished in the top ten in runs scored, hits, doubles, total bases, extra base hits and runs batted in every year from 1910 through 1914. He finished in the top ten in the American League Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, finishing third in 1914, his highest showing. Baker was the hero of the 1911 World Series, hitting two home runs to help the Athletics win the series, which earned him the nickname \"Home Run\" Baker. Baker held out the 1915 season when manager and owner Connie Mack refused to increase his salary, and was sold to the New York Yankees in 1916 after American League president Ban Johnson intervened. He finished his career as the third baseman for the Yankees pennant-winning teams in 1921 and 1922. Baker was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nStuffy McInnis\nMcInnis was the final member of the $100,000 infield to join. He started his career as an 18-year-old little-used backup infielder for the Athletics in 1909, and played a little more in 1910. In 1909 and 1910, he played more games backing up Barry at shortstop than at any other position. Before the 1911 season, Mack decided to make McInnis his regular first baseman, replacing the popular veteran Harry Davis, although McInnis did have to begin the season as the Athletics' shortstop when Barry became ill before taking over at first base. Defensively as a first baseman, he was known for having exceptional reach. Between 1910 and 1914, McInnis played 614 games for the Athletics, getting 715 hits in 2,228 at bats for a batting average of .321. He led the American League in singles in 1914, and finished in the top ten in batting average, hits, total bases, runs batted in and singles every year from 1912 through 1914. In both 1912 and 1913, he also finished in the top ten in slugging percentage and on-base percentage. He received Most Valuable Player votes every season from 1911 through 1914, finishing seventh in both 1913 and 1914. McInnis is the only member of the $100,000 infield to remain with the Athletics beyond 1915. He was eventually traded to the Boston Red Sox in 1918 in exchange for Larry Gardner, Hick Cady and Tilly Walker, where he played on Boston's 1918 World Championship team. He also reteamed with Barry on the 1919 Boston Red Sox. Before finishing his career in 1927 he also played with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nSee also\n\n* Whiz Kids\n\nReferences\n" .

In 2 years and 30,000 miles of travel throughout the USA and Europe, the guitar passed through the hands of over 65 players, each of whom recorded a piece with it, signed it and then passed it on to the next player. The result was a 2-CD album released on Bridge Records, Inc. in January 2013 (BRIDGE 9381A/B). 50% of the album proceeds go to CARE, an organization fighting global poverty. The guitar has been identified as a FujiGen Gakki EJ-2 (with a missing neck pickup).

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$100_hamburger?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "$100 hamburger (\"hundred-dollar hamburger\") is aviation slang for the excuse a general aviation pilot might use to fly.\n\nBackground\nA $100 hamburger trip typically involves flying a short distance (less than two hours), eating at an airport restaurant, and flying home. \"$100\" originally referred to the approximate cost of renting or operating a light general aviation aircraft, such as a Cessna 172, for the time it took to fly round-trip to a nearby airport. However, increasing fuel prices have since caused an increase in hourly operating costs for most airplanes, and a Cessna 172 now costs US$95–$130 per Hobbs hour to rent, including fuel. In Perth, Western Australia, a similar mentality resulted in the 'Rotto Bun Run'. A group of pilots who had run out of hot cross buns on Good Friday decided to fly to the closest open bakery on Rottnest Island. The run is now an annual charity event.\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$2_billion_arms_deal?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The $2 billion arms deal is an arms procurement deal in Nigeria that resulted in the embezzlement of $2 billion through the office of the National Security Adviser under the leadership of Colonel Sambo Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser. The illegal deal was revealed following an interim report of the presidential investigations committee on arms procurement under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. The committee report showed an extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and an additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against Islamic insurgency in Nigeria. The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for that purpose. Several reports suggested that part of the disbursed fund was diverted for the sponsoring of the re-election of Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the office of the National Security Adviser. He was arrested by the Department of State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order.Colonel Dasuki was arrested on 1 December 2015 by the Department of State Security Services and transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for further interrogation. In a written statement, he mentioned several notable Nigerians who were involved in the arms procurement deal. Chief Raymond Dokpesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, was mentioned in connection with the deal alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.\n\nInvestigative committee\nThe arms procurement investigative committee was inaugurated on 31 August 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the procurement of ammunition to fight against insurgency during the administration of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The interim report of the committee revealed several illicit and fraudulent financial transactions. The report revealed an extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and inexplicable spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. This amount excluded grants received by the state governments and funds received by the Directorate of State Services and the Nigerian Police Force.The committee analyzed how funds were transferred to the office of the National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Armed Forces in local and foreign currencies.The committee observed that about $2.2 billion was disbursed for the procurement of ammunition to tackle insurgency but regretted that despite this enormous financial transactions, little or nothing was spent for the procurement of the arms for which the fund was disbursed.The committee discovered that out of the 513 contracts awarded at $8,356,525,184.32, ₦2,189,265,724,404.55 and £54,000.00, about 53 were failed contracts amounting to about $2,378,939,066.27 and ₦13,729,342,329.87 respectively.The committee also noted that the amount of foreign currencies spent on failed contracts was more than twice the $1 billion loan approved by the National Assembly for borrowing from the World bank to fight insurgency.The investigative committee also discovered a total transfer of ₦3.850 billion to a single company by Colonel Dansuki, the former National Security Adviser. These transactions were made with neither agreements nor fulfilment of tax obligations to the Federal Government of Nigeria. Further investigation by the committee provided evidence that phantom and fictitious contracts to the tune of ₦2,219,188,609.50, $1,671,742,613.58 and £9,905,477.00 was awarded between March 2012 and March 2015 by Colonel Dasuki.In addition, the funds disbursed for the purchase of 12 helicopters, 4 Alpha Jets, bombs and other ammunition were not utilized for those purposes. The committee also noted that Dansuki directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to transfer a total sum of $132,050,486.97 dollars and £9,905,473.5 to the accounts of the Societe D'equipmente Internationaux in West Africa, the UK, and the US with no documentation. Subsequent to this investigative committee's interim report, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of Colonel Dasuki on alleged siphoning of billions of dollars allocated for the procurement of arms. He also ordered the arrest of all those indicted.\n\nProbing and prosecutions\nSeveral notable Nigerians were involved in the arms procurement deals, including Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications PLC, alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.Sambo Dasuki masterminded the arms procurement deal. On 17 November 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of Colonel Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser, on alleged siphoning of the arms procurement funds. Dasuki claimed that ordering his arrest by the President is illegal. He denied that he was invited by the investigation committee on issues related to arms procurement.According to Premium Times, Dansuki said \"I have never been invited formally or informally to appear before the panel. I am therefore not only surprised but embarrassed by the seeming indictment by the panel purportedly operating from the office of the National Security Adviser that never contacted me\".Prior to ordering his arrest by the president for siphoning the arms procurement fund, on 19 July 2015, the operative of the Department of State Security Service stormed his residence at Abuja and confiscated his international passport. He was charged with unlawful possession of firearms and foreign currencies. On 3 November 2015, Justice Adeniyi Ademola, the presiding Judge of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, ordered the DSS to release his passport to enable in travel for medical attention. Despite this ruling, the DSS prevented him from traveling abroad by putting him under a house arrest insisting that Dasuki have some questions to answer on the $2 billion arms procurement deal.On 18 November 2015, a US-based newspaper, The Washington Times, in a report entitled \"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Dupes the US\", criticized President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki house under siege and for declining the order of the court permitting Dasuki to travel for medical attention. The newspaper described Buhari's action as an attempt to destroy his political opponents like Dasuki with tyrannical methods.In the same vein, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, a former Liaison Officer to President Shehu Shagari and a founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum, and Frederick Fasehun, a leader of the Oodua Peoples Congress, berated President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki's house under siege and for disobeying the court order. Both leaders described Buhari's action as \"deliberate neglect of the rule of law or re-introduction of subtle autocracy in the leadership of the country\". They described Buhari's anti-corruption war as \"selective\"Yakassai said, \"Since President Buhari and the Attorney General have decided to disobey the court order which says that Col. Sambo Dasuki be allowed to travel abroad for medical attention, it means that Buhari is all out on a revenge mission.\"Fredrick Fasheun said, \"Where a court order has been given and the President flouts the court order, how can you claim change in the democracy, except change from democracy to autocracy, as we are seeing now.\" On 1 December 2015, Colonel Dasuki was arrested by the Department of State Security Services and transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for further interrogation.Prior to Dasuki's arrest, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested by the Department of the State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order which led to Dasuki's arrest. After Dasuki was transferred to the EFCC, he initially decided not to comment on the issue or write any statement, claiming that he had been subjected to media trial.The EFCC operatives then issued Dasuki a copy of the statement made by Shaibu Salisu, a statement that seemed rather implicating. Dasuki was shocked by Salisu's confessional statement. According to The Nation, Colonel Dasuki said, \"You mean Salisu wrote all these! You mean he said these! Give me a pen and paper.\" Dasuki gave a long list of people involved in the deal.He mentioned Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. On 1 December 2015, Chief Raymond Dopesi, the Chair Emeritus of Daar Communication PLC, was arrested at his residence in Abuja by the EFCC in connections with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki.Preliminary evidence showed that Chief Dopesi received ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent reasons for the financial transaction. Chief Dopesi, said the ₦2.1 billion received from the Office of the National Security Adviser was payment for media and political campaign for the re-election of President Goodluck Jonathan.On Tuesday, 8 December 2015, Chief Dokpesi was arraigned by the Federal Government of Nigeria before a federal high court sitting in Abuja on six count charges of money laundering and other financial crimes.The prosecutor maintained that the transfer of a total sum of ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser breaches section 58 (4) (b) of the Public Procurement Act 2007 and punishable under Section 58 (6) and (7) of the same Act, as well as under Section 17 (b) of the EFCC Act, 2004. Dokpesi plead not guilty of the charges and requested the court to grant him bail on liberal terms. The case was adjourned till 10 December 2015 to consider his bail request. The presiding judge, Justice Gabriel Kolawole, ordered the EFCC to detain him pending the determination of his bail application. On 10 December 2015, Rotimi Jacob, counsel to the EFCC, argued that granting Dokpesi bail would truncate the trial application for bail. Having heard from the prosecutor and defence counsel, Justice Kolawole adjourned the hearing for the bail application till 14 December 2015. He slated 17 February, 18 February and 2 March, 3 March 2016 to commence the hearing on the six count charges slammed against him. On 14 December 2015, Justice Gabriel Kolawole ruled that Chief Dokpesi should be granted a bail in the sum of ₦400 million with two surety in like sum. He said the first surety must be a retired or serving director in the civil service and the second surety must be a private investor with a track record of tax payment in the last 3 years. He maintain that Dokpesi should remain in Kuje Prison until the bail conditions are met. He also ordered the EFCC not to re-arrest him after the bail for interrogation for more than 8 hours and 30 minutes. Prior to the arms procurement saga, Chief Dokpesi and Africa Independent Television was accused of partisan for airing some controversial documentaries such as The Lion of Bourdillon, which Chief Bola Tinubu considered defamatory. This documentary generated several controversies, leading to a ₦150 billion libel suit against AIT by Chief Bola Tinubu. On 1 December 2015, Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, was arrested and detained by the EFCC in connection with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki. He was arrested alongside Dokpesi.Preliminary evidence showed that Attahiru Bafarawa received ₦4.6 billion from the office of the National Security Adviser with no clear basis for the financial transaction. In response to the allegation, Bafarawa said he received the money from the Office of the National Security Adviser for spiritual purpose. On 8 December 2015, the family of Bafawara in a statement signed by the Media Aide to the former governor, Alhaji Yusuf Dingyadi advised the EFCC to charge Bafawara and his son to court if there are evidence against them rather than keeping them in their custody. According to Thisday, the family of Bafawara said Today is one week since Bafarawa was detained by the EFCC. And today marks two weeks that his son Sagir Bafarawa has been in detention. Why are they being detained without charges? If the EFCC has any evidence that they have committed any crime it should charge them to court. We thought that the era of detaining people while searching for evidence was over. We call on the EFCC to release them forthwith if they have nothing against them. On 30 November 2015, Ambassador Bashir Yuguda, a former Minister of State for Finance, was arrested and detained by the EFCC in connections with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki. He was arrested alongside Chief Raymond Dokpesi, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa and his son.Preliminary evidence showed that Ambassador Yuguda received ₦1.5 billion from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent basis for the financial transaction. The money was transferred into his account through an unknown company for inexplicable purpose. According to Premium Times, \"The funds were directly transferred to him from the NSA office and he has been unable to explain the rationale for the transfer. The transfers were made to his account between December 2014 and May 2015\".Additional ₦1.275 billion was also transferred to his account during the campaign for the 2015 Nigerian general electionAlso ₦775 million was transferred into his account from the office of the Accountant General of the Federation.On 30 November 2015, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested in connection with the arms procurement deal. Investigation reveal that Salisu operates a joint account with Sambo Dasuki. According to Thisday, EFCC operatives said \"We just discovered a huge sum of money in foreign currencies in a joint account – being operated by the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki and a director in his office, one Shauibu Salisu. He is also being interrogated by EFCC operatives.\" Salisu's confessional statements led to Dasuki's arrest. Investigation also revealed a payment of ₦650 million into the account Nduka Obaigbena, owner of Arise TV and Thisday publisher. He denied receiving any money from the Office of the National Security Adviser.On 12 December 2015, the management of Thisday denied receiving money related to arms procurement from the former National Security Adviser. The management in its response to an invitation letter from the EFCC dated 8 November 2015, received in its Abuja office on 8 December 2015, said all funds received from the Office of the National Security Adviser , \"are payments for compensation to mitigate the dastardly Boko Haram twin bombings of the ThisDay Newspapers offices in Abuja and Kaduna on Thursday April 26, 2012\". On Thursday 3 December 2015, , an Air vice-marshal (rtd) and Chairman of the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety, was arrested by EFCC on alleged involvement in the arms procurement deal. He was accused of illegal diversion of ₦600 million meant for the procurement of military boats for use in fighting against insurgency. However, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Tuesday 6 June 2017, discharged and acquitted Atawodi. In a judgement delivered by Justice Tani Hassan-Yusuf, the Court dismissed the judgment of an Abuja High Court which earlier asked Atawodi to open his defense. On 14 December 2015, the EFCC arraigned Colonel Dasuki, Bafarawa, Saliu Atawodi, Dokpesi, Yuguda, Salisu, Sagir Attahiru, Dahaltu Investment Limited, Aminu Baba-Kusa, former Executive Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, and his company Acacia Holding Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited before Justice Hussein Baba Yusuf of Abuja High Court sitting at Maitama on alleged unlawful diversion of public funds.\n\nEvidences\nSupposed several pieces of unsubstantiated evidence allegedly established the fact that about $2 billions was transferred into the Office of the National Security Adviser.Premium Times published a letter sent to Goodluck Jonathan by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala requesting the former President's approval of a transfer of about $300 million (£5.5 million) from money recovered from the late General Sani Abacha to the office of the National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a few days before the presidential election held in April 2015.The letter, dated 20 January 2015, was addressed to the former president following the 12 January 2015 request for funds by the office of the National Security Adviser under the leadership of Dasuki for the procurement of arms and intelligence equipment. The letter reads Please find a request by the National Security Adviser (NSA) for the transfer of $300 million and £5.5 million of the recovered Abacha funds to an ONSA (Office of the National Security Adviser) operations account. The NSA has explained that this is to enable the purchase of ammunition, security, and other intelligence equipment for the security agencies in order to enable them fully confront the ongoing Boko Haram threat. His request is sequel to the meeting you chaired with the committee on the use of recovered funds where the decision was made that recovered Abacha funds would be split 50-50 between urgent security needs to confront Boko Haram and development need (including a portion for the Future Generations window of the Sovereign Wealth Fund). This letter is to seek your approval to borrow these funds, for now, to disburse to the NSA. These funds form part of the projected Federal Government Independent Revenue, to be appropriated, in the light and for accountability, given the peculiar nature of security and intelligence transactions, we would expect the NSA to account to Your Excellency for the utilisation of the funds. The transfer was approved by Goodluck Jonathan. Though it is difficult to see how a formal letter for approval became the evidence for corruption. Sambo Dasuki has been locked up indefinitely and refused a court date. Many believe it is because he can give account of his expenditure and that the Buhari government took delivery of many of the arms (which they denied was bought) and subsequently used them to fight the war. In a counter-claim, while speaking in Washington DC on \"Presidential elections and democratic consolidation in Africa: Case studies on Nigeria and Tanzania,\" a forum co-hosted by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Goodluck Jonathan refuted the allegations by the EFCC and its operative that he awarded a contract potentially worth $2 billion for arms procurement during his administration. He said \"Where did the money come from? I did not award any $2 billion contract for procurement of weapons.\"\n\nConfessional statements\nSeveral confessional statements help in the investigation of the arms procurement deal. Salisu, who operated a joint bank account with Dasuki, claimed to have withdrawn $47 million from the Central Bank of Nigeria; the money was delivered in 11 briefcases to Dasuki at his residence. Salisu's statement reads “I could remember on the 20/11/2014, I was directed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki to go to the CBN and collect the sum of $47m in cash and the balance in Euro and the directive was obeyed and the monies were delivered to the NSA in about 11 suit cases. I acknowledged the receipt of the money from the CBN which was handed over to M.S. Dasuki. I did not benefit even one cent. The request for the funds was tag(sic) Special Services signed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki, addressed to the Governor of CBN.I did not know the source of the money into our CBN Account. The foreign currencies that I collected from the CBN were delivered to the NSA in his house, No. 13, John Kadiya Street, Asokoro.\" Ambassador Yuguda claimed to have delivered a sum of N600 million to six chairmen of the National Working Committee, the Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the People's Democratic Party for the 2015 general election. According to him, the beneficiaries includes Yerima Abdullahi, Chief Bode George, Peter Odili, Jim Nwobodo, Attahiru Bafarawa and Ahmadu Ali.He transferred N300 million to BAM Properties, whose account details were sent to him by Bello Haliru, a former National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. He also claimed to have sent N200 million to Bello Sarkin Yaki, the Governorship aspirant in Kebbi State. According to him, Mahmud Shinkafi, the former Governor of Zamfara State, received ₦100 million. Bashir's confessional statement reads For the cash disbursement of ₦600million, it was meant for the six zonal chairmen for Contact and Mobilisation Committees for Election of 2015. The chairmen are Bode George, Amb. Yerima Abdullahi; Peter Odili; Attahiru Bafarawa; Jim Nwobodo; Ahmadu Ali. The sum of ₦100million was given to each chairman. I gave the money in company of Prof. Alkali, who was Political Adviser to former president. The zonal chairmen are for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). I also instructed Jabbama Limited to transfer the sum of N100m to Dalhatu Limited on the request of Attahiru Bafarawa. I also remember that Bello Sarkin Yaki was among the people that the then NSA instructed that I send the sum of N200million to. He was the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kebbi State. I knew the chairman of Stallion Limited whose second name I cannot remember. Between December 2014 to June 2015, on the instruction of the then NSA, I introduced Jabbama Limited to a staff of the company on the instruction of the chairman. When the account was in credit, disbursement was made from time to time on the instruction of the then NSA. Part in foreign exchange or transfers. I wish to add that sometime in February 2015, I instructed Jabbama to transfer the sum of N300m to BAM Properties. The account was given to me by Bello Haliru as one of the people the former NSA requested me to give money. I also remember that Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi was sent the sum of N100million on the instruction of the then NSA. Further to my statement of 30th November, 2015, I have brought the sum of $829,800(equivalent to N200m) and N600m was given to me to distribute to the six PDP Zonal Committee chairmen. I don’t know who are the directors of Dalhatu Investment Limited but funds were transferred to the company’s account on the instruction of Dalhatu Bafarawa for the total amount of N1.5billion received from the then NSA by Jabbama Limited. I shall endeavour to recover the sum of N600million given to the six zonal PDP committee chairmen, while I appeal to the commission to use their machineries to trace the remaining balance of the money transferred to various accounts In a counter-claim, Chief Bode George denied the allegations of receiving a total sum of ₦100 million from Yuguda for the 2015 general election. He described the claim by Yuguda as \"mischievous and deliberately fraudulent.\" Bode's statement reads “My attention has been drawn to another mischievous and deliberately fraudulent claim that I collected N100 million from Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. This is another blatant falsehood, stripped of any iota of truth. This is yet again a depraved continuation of lynch mob journalism orchestrated by an online newspaper. The salient fact is that very early this year, long before the election period, the party set up Contact and Mobilization Committee for each zone to reconcile various factions and ensure a firm unity of purpose within the zones before the election. I was elected as the Chairman for the South-West zone. The committee which was made up of 18 senior members of the party with distinguished history of honour and exemplary leadership, met at least 10 times in my office in Lagos. These people travelled all the way from every corner of the South-West, with three members representing each state. All of them are very much alive to testify to my assertions. Sometime in the middle of these deliberations, Yuguda came to me and said the party was reimbursing the 18 elders of the committee for their transportation, accommodation and feeding allowance for the work that was done. The committee later submitted the report of its deliberations to the party and then wound up. For all these efforts Yuguda gave the committee only $30,000. That was less than N6 million at that time. Yuguda can never claim that he gave the Committee N100 million. That is the figment of the imagination of rascally scribblers purporting to be journalists. Again, facts are sacred.”\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* koko, level (20 December 2015). \"Dasuki threaten to expose more beneficiaries of the Arm Scam Deal\". koko level blog. koko level.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$40_a_Day?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "$40 a Day was a Food Network show hosted by Rachael Ray. In each episode, Rachael takes a one-day trip to an American, Canadian, or European city with only $40 US, to spend on food. While touring the city, she finds restaurants to go to (often based on local recommendations), and usually manages to fit three meals and some sort of snack or after-dinner drink into her small budget. The show premiered on April 1, 2002, five months after the debut of 30 Minute Meals, making it her second show on the Food Network. Some clips are sometimes used in Ray's later series, Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Another Food Network series, Giada's Weekend Getaways starring Giada De Laurentiis, is similar in format. In 2010, The Travel Channel began airing reruns of the show. As of 2013, the show is no longer in reruns on the Travel Channel.\n\nDetails\nAccording to Ray, visiting a fast food restaurant, particularly those of national chains, is considered cheating (she says so explicitly in the Orlando episode). On occasion, smaller sit-down restaurant chains (such as Bahama Breeze in the Las Vegas episode, or Bongos in the South Beach episode) are visited. Generally, non-food items and non-food-related activities are not included in her budget. Rachael always offers tips on what to see in the various cities, as well as hints on how to save money and find bargains while traveling. She also emphasizes researching whatever city she plans to visit through the Internet and asking the local citizens for their recommendations. Initially, Rachael only used item prices against her $40 limit. She started including applicable taxes and tips during the first season. On occasion, she does go over budget; however, during her trips to Philadelphia and Arizona, she did so on purpose. Her cheapest day was in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003, when she spent just under $25 USD including taxes and tips (at the time, less than $40 Canadian, although she budgeted for $40 USD). On occasions, she has had to get creative to stay on-budget; for example, she accidentally blew half her budget on her second meal in her first Miami episode. The pilot, shot in Los Angeles, had a 12-hour limit, but subsequent episodes raised it to 24 hours. Usually episodes begin in the morning with breakfast, occasionally brunch. Episodes almost always feature four paid meals, but on at least one occasion, in the Research Triangle (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC), she did five meals. Also on rare occasion, only three meals are paid, and a fourth ends up being free. On only one occasion, in Antigua, she partook of a hotel's free Continental breakfast, but she still did four paid meals in that episode. On her first visit to Las Vegas during the first season, Rachael began with dinner and stayed overnight, ending with breakfast. She did several episodes in Europe when the euro was still valued less than the U.S. dollar. She has not visited Europe since the U.S. dollar has fallen under the euro in value. She has also visited several island locales, including Bermuda and Antigua, both of which generally accept the U.S. dollar. Ray has occasionally drawn controversy when some meals end up calculating with less-than-traditional tips.\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nSeason 1 (2002–03)\n\n\nSeason 2 (2003–04)\n\n\nSeason 3 (2004–05)\n\n\nSeason 4 (2005–06)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website \n* $40 a Day on IMDb \n* $40 a Day at TV.com" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$50,000_Reward?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "$50,000 Reward is a 1924 American silent western film directed by Clifford S. Elfelt and starring Ken Maynard, Esther Ralston and Bert Lindley.\n\nIntroduction\nThe film is set in western Montana in the 1920s during a time when men rode horses as a means of transport. It is a black and white silent film, and one of the directors (Clifford S. Elfelt) longest running time film. This film was one of the first features for Ken Maynard, the main actor who plays Ted Sherwood, who quickly became a hugely popular star of early westerns. Esther Ralston, a beautiful and popular actress of silent films, appears as Maynard's leading lady. The film begins with a screen that says, \"In Montana, things often happen with a surprising suddenness.\" This is followed by a black screen with the words, \"Help!\" appearing multiple times. What appears to be a brawl including guns is unfolding across the street where a business owner notices and calls for help. Then, we see a black screen that says, \"Get him boys, don't let him get away.\" Then there is some more brawling, followed by a black screen that says, \"I've got what you're after, try and get it.\" Some more brawling, followed by a screen that says, \"50,000 reward to the man who gets him.\" The men start running after Tex Sherwood as it appears, and he runs away on his horse. The group of men all hop on their horses and follow Ken until they see he has gone up a hill with his horse and the rest of them can't seem to get up there. A black screen then appears and it says, \"Tex Sherwood cowpuncher from the Rio Grande, the cause of all the excitement, who has come to Montana to transact some business of a personal nature,\" Then, we see a black screen that says, \"Buck Scofield, the leader of a lawless outfit,\" and \"Tarzan, Tex Sherwood's pal, by himself.\" Here, we can tell that Tarzan is Ted Sherwood's horse. Then we see Ted and a black screen that says, \"We fooled 'em boy, didn't we?\" Tarzan nods, and Sherwood rides him down onto the other side of the hill. The scenes change, and we are now in an office. A black screen says, \"Asa Holman, president of the bank, and a big man in local affairs.\" We see this character who appears to be Asa Holman speaking and a black screen that says, \"Tex Sherwood is in town with the papers. I've offered Buck and his gang $50,000 reward to get those documents.\" We then see a man reply, he is Eli Higgins, Holman's lawyer. Holman and Higgins exchange back and forth. Holman looks concerned, saying \"I have millions at stake. If he records those papers, I am ruined.\" At this point in the film, we find out why it is that Holman is so concerned. We find out that Holman is a sponsor for a large reclamation project, part of which is a million dollar dam nearing completion in the mountains. All of this takes place during the first 5 minutes of the film and sets the course for the plot to unfold. On the one hand, we have Ted Sherwood, which has just received a piece of land. And on the other hand, we have Asa Holman, the president of the bank, who has a conflict of interest in Sherwood's acquirement. For this reason, Holman has placed a bounty on Sherwood and has a group of men trying to capture Sherwood and bring him to Holman.\n\nPremise\nThe film is about Tex Sherwood, a man who has just acquired a piece of land. There is a plot twist when he finds out that this land is soon to be irrigated by a dam. Asa Holman, the banker, knows that the ownership of property deed must be registered the next day, but does not let Tex know. Instead, he offers a $50,000 reward for his capture.\n\nCast\n\n* Ken Maynard as Tex Sherwood \n* Esther Ralston as Carolyn Jordan \n* Bert Lindley as Anthony Jordan \n* Edward Peil Sr. as Buck Scofield \n* Lillian Leighton  as Mrs. Miller \n* Charles Newton as Pa Miller \n* Frank Whitson as Asa Holman \n* William F.

The album was initially a widely circulated internet-only release, and made available to stream for free on the band's website prior to Interscope Records signing the band. The song \"Wat Pomp?\" had a music video released on 6 June 2009, followed by \"Enter the Ninja\" (a track with previous exposure as a viral video on YouTube and other video-hosting services), which received an official release on 9 August 2010. \"Fish Paste\" and \"Beat Boy\" have also been released as promotional singles. \"Enter the Ninja\" debuted at #37 in the UK Music Charts on 19 September 2010. Following the group's signing to Interscope in the US, it was announced that $O$ would be re-released in physical format with a different track listing. Diplo produced one of the new tracks on the re-release, \"Evil Boy\", for which a promotional video was made available on 6 October 2010. The US iTunes digital release includes the previously hidden track \"$O$\" separately, a bonus track \"Wat Pomp?\" and an alternate version of \"Evil Boy\" titled as \"Evil Boy (F**k You In The Face Mix)\" not present on US physical release.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$h*!_My_Dad_Says?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "$#*! My Dad Says (pronounced \"Bleep My Dad Says\") is an American sitcom television series produced by Warner Bros. Television that aired on CBS. It was based on the Twitter feed Shit My Dad Says, created by Justin Halpern and consisting of quotations from his father, Sam. The show originally ran from September 23, 2010, to February 17, 2011, and aired on Thursdays at 8:30 pm/7:30 pm Central. After 18 episodes aired, the series was replaced in mid-season by Rules of Engagement, which had moved to Thursdays from Mondays. On May 15, 2011, CBS cancelled the series after one season.\n\nPlot\nEd is a very opinionated 72-year-old who has been divorced three times. His two adult sons, Henry and Vince, are accustomed to his unsolicited and often politically incorrect rants. When Henry, a struggling writer and blogger, can no longer afford his rent, he is forced to move back in with Ed, which creates new issues in their tricky father–son relationship. As weeks go by Henry is unable to find a job as a writer, mostly due to the lack of good material. He finally lands a job, when during his interview Ed interrupts with an irrational phone call that sparks the interest of the eccentric editor conducting the interview. Henry is ultimately hired, but is forced to continue living with Ed in order to have readily available material via his father's unsolicited rants, hence the title $#*! My Dad Says.\n\nCast\n\n* William Shatner as Dr. Edison Milford \"Ed\" Goodson III \n* Jonathan Sadowski as Henry Goodson \n* Will Sasso as Vince Goodson \n* Nicole Sullivan as Bonnie Goodson \n* Tim Bagley as Tim\n\nDevelopment and production\nIn November 2009, CBS announced that it was developing a television pilot based on the Twitter feed, which would be written by Halpern and Patrick Schumacker. William Shatner landed the lead role in late February 2010, which triggered a green-light to produce the pilot. Nicole Sullivan and Ryan Devlin came on board in early March. Casting was completed with the addition of Will Sasso as Vince and Stephanie Lemelin as Sam later that month. Both Sasso and Sullivan had previously been cast-mates on the series Mad TV. The series was picked up by CBS in May 2010, with reports saying that the role of Henry (played by Ryan Devlin in the pilot) would be recast. In July, Jonathan Sadowski was cast in the role. The character Sam (Stephanie Lemelin) was eliminated, never appearing in the broadcast pilot or subsequent episodes.\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nReception\n$#*! My Dad Says received negative reviews, with Metacritic assigning it a score of 28/100. Over 12 million viewers watched the premiere, although the next two episodes lost nearly 20% of that audience. The fourth and fifth episodes improved in ratings, being 10.16 million and 10.91 million respectively. The show won the award for Favorite New TV Comedy at the 37th People's Choice Awards on January 5, 2011.\n\nControversy\nThe title of the broadcast series was modified from the source material in order to comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations on the use of profane language during prime time. The profanity was also toned down and modified from Halpern's Twitter feeds. On May 19, 2010, CBS announced the show's official name and 8:30 pm time slot at its upfront presentation of the fall 2010 schedule. Addressing reporters' concerns regarding the title, the network assured them that the expletive would not be used in promos. Soon thereafter, the Parents Television Council announced that it was protesting the title because it alluded to an obscenity. The PTC threatened CBS with broadcast license challenges for any affiliate airing the show or its promos before 10 pm. Responding to the controversy, CBS stated, \"[The show] will in no way be indecent and will adhere to all CBS standards. Parents who choose to do so will find the show can be easily blocked using their V Chip.\" Show star Shatner commented on the show's title, saying \"We say spit; why can't we say shit?\" In addition, Bill Gorman from TVbytheNumbers wrote that the PTC protest was just giving the show more publicity, which he expected would boost ratings. At the July 2010 Television Critics Association press tour, Shatner further commented on the title saying, \"The word 'shit' is around us. It isn't a terrible term. It's a natural function. Why are we pussyfooting?\"\n\nSee also\n\n* Surviving Jack, a second series surrounding the blog posts by Justin Halpern\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* $#*!

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$pread?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "$pread was a quarterly magazine by and for sex workers and those who support their rights. The magazine's focus was: \"personal experiences and political insights\" and it \"contain(ed) practical information like news, features, health columns, and resources related to the sex industry\".\n\nHistory\nArticles were written by readers as well as by figures from academic, cultural, and literary backgrounds, most of whom were current or former sex workers. The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega. $pread was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at independent bookstores and via national distributors. A co-editor said, \"We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot.\" $pread published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. $pread supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program \"helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes\", said Audacia Ray, an executive editor at the magazine. As of August 30, 2010, $pread ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if \"there was $100k made available\".\n\nCriticism\nBecause $pread was part of the sex workers rights movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading: Among feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.\n\n$pread Book\nThe Feminist Press released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled $pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution.\n\nMary Christmas\n(For the 2002 film, see Mary Christmas (film).

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/$pringfield_(or,_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Legalized_Gambling)?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\", also known as \"$pringfield\", is the tenth episode of The Simpsons' fifth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 1993. In the episode, Springfield decides to legalize gambling to revitalize its economy. A casino owned by Mr. Burns is created and Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. Meanwhile, Marge develops a gambling addiction, Bart starts his own casino, and Burns develops an odd personality in a parody of Howard Hughes. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to the films Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, The Wizard of Oz, Rain Man, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nPlot\nThe economy of Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to suggestions from citizens on how to improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, including Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play on a slot machine. When she wins, Marge immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, so he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinating in jars, and wearing tissue boxes instead of shoes. Due to her addiction, Marge spends her waking moments at the casino and neglects her family. For instance, she forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her geography pageant. Homer bursts into the casino and barges around searching for Marge. The security cameras capture Homer's rampage, and when Mr. Burns sees him he demotes him back to his old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Mr. Burns decides to return. Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, as she finally realizes that she has a problem. Lisa does win a special prize in the geography pageant, as Homer's poor costume design gives Lisa the appearance that she did the work all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize, as his costume is simply a note taped to his shirt that reads \"Idaho\".\n\nProduction\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how \"crummy\" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how \"crummy\" and \"dismal\" Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The \"way they radiate out\" had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\". There was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was \"such a good sport\" and had \"a great sense of humor\". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was \"bound to happen\" sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as \"Senator\" by Homer.\n\nCultural references\nThe title is a reference to the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, the music of which was composed by Laurie Johnson. Two of his songs, Happy-go-lively and Rue de la park can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by Keir Dullea's character Dave Bowman in the end of the 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film Rain Man. Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album For Adults Only, which was recorded at a casino at midnight. Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show The Gong Show. Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate Howard Hughes, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The \"Spruce Moose\", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the \"Spruce Goose\". Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz when the Scarecrow demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the Pythagorean theorem recited applies only to right triangles, not isosceles triangles.\n\nReception\nIn its original American broadcast, \"$pringfield\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of December 13 to December 19, 1993, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.7, translating to 11 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way.\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \"There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun.\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecim's eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\" at The Simpsons.com \n* \"$pringfield episode capsule\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22...And_Ladies_of_the_Club%22?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"...And Ladies of the Club\" is a novel, written by Helen Hooven Santmyer, about a group of women in the fictional town of Waynesboro, Ohio who begin a women's literary club, which evolves through the years into a significant community service organization in the town. The novel, which looks at the club as it changes throughout the years, spans decades in the lives of the women involved in the club, between 1868 and 1932. Many characters are introduced in the course of the novel, but the primary characters are Anne Gordon and Sally Rausch, who in 1868 are new graduates of the Waynesboro Female College. They marry soon after the opening of the book, and the decades that follow chronicle their marriages and those of their children and grandchildren. Santmyer focuses not just on the lives of the women in the Club, but also their families, friends, politics, and developments in their small town and the larger world.\n\nSynopsis\nOn the day of their graduation from the Waynesboro Female College in 1868, best friends Anne Alexander and Sarah \"Sally\" Cochran are invited along with several of the College's female teachers by Mrs. Lowrey, who along with her professor husband operates the College, to become founding members of a new local society, the Waynesboro Woman's Club. The club is intended to promote culture and literature among the educated citizens of the Ohio town, while avoiding controversial subjects such as women's suffrage and other reform movements. Socially ambitious Sally agrees to join because she believes the club might become important in the town, and wants to establish herself as a serious-minded member of adult society. Introspective Anne, the class valedictorian, joins in order to support Sally. Other early members of the Club include Miss Louisa Tucker, a beautiful but cold mathematics teacher who later marries the commencement speaker General Deming; scholarly Amanda Reid, who overcame a poor background to earn a degree from Oberlin and has returned to teach at the Female College; Miss Agatha Pinney, an elderly teacher whose sciatica leads to a secret addiction to the laudanum she is prescribed; Mary, Thomasina and Eliza Ballard, the wife and daughters of a prominent local judge; and the Misses Gardiner, two reclusive spinsters whose nephew, Douglas, attends Princeton and becomes a local attorney and judge. The club's membership grows over time to include the daughters, granddaughters, and other relatives of the early members, and other society women, particularly the wives of the town's numerous and often-changing Protestant ministers. Although the club itself is framed as non-controversial, club meetings and social events sponsored by its members often lead to discussions and conflicts stemming from the widely varying social and political views of the members and their families on subjects such as race, class, ethnic and religious biases, women's rights, labor reform, and the morality of drinking alcohol, attending the theater and celebrating Christmas. Anne, the daughter of a doctor, is in love with Dr. John \"Dock\" Gordon, her father's protege and a friend of her late brother Rob who was killed in the Civil War. Depressed by his war experiences, John gave up his medical practice for several years, but with Anne's encouragement resumes his practice and the two marry. Anne's father consents to the match, but warns her that John is too affected by the suffering he sees as a doctor and that he is likely to make a poor husband, so Anne will have to be very tolerant. Sally develops a relationship with John's friend Captain Ludwig Rausch, who has bought a small local rope-making business and begun building it into a large, updated factory. Although Ludwig is a German immigrant, his ambitions match Sally's and her banker father, approving of his work ethic and prospects, agrees to their marriage. Thomasina Ballard also makes an unexpected marriage to a church organist as a result of a wedding poem she wrote for Anne. Over the years, Anne and Sally continue their club activities while raising families. Anne and John have a son, Johnny, and a daughter, Binny; Sally and Ludwig have a daughter, Elsa, and several sons. Although John is an intelligent and caring doctor, he is secretly unfaithful to Anne as a way of relieving the pressure of his past war memories and current responsibilities. Anne eventually finds out, and suspects that John has even fathered a child with his cousin Jessamine Stevens in New Orleans. Although deeply hurt by John's behavior, Anne, remembering her father's advice, chooses to overlook it and even welcomes Jessamine and her son when they later move to Waynesboro. Meanwhile, Ludwig becomes a successful industrialist and Sally a prominent local hostess, later taking over the presidency of the Club. Ludwig hires Eliza Ballard as his secretary after she is forced to leave her previous position in her late father's former law firm due to gossiping about partner Doug Gardiner's romance with an Irish Catholic girl whom he later marries. Despite Eliza's gossip and sharp tongue occasionally causing trouble in the town, she shows a softer side by caring for Ariana McCune, a terminally ill young girl who ran away from her oppressively religious parents. Miss Pinney's laudanum addiction eventually becomes public knowledge after she appears increasingly disheveled and unable to control her primary school class. At the instigation of Louisa Deming, Miss Pinney is forced to retire on a small pension and her laudanum supply is cut off. Embarrassed and suffering severe withdrawal, she dies of a heart attack while trying to burn herself to death. Elsa secretly loves her childhood friend Johnny, but Johnny falls in love with the Demings' daughter Julia, who like her mother is beautiful but cold. Julia is more affectionate towards Johnny's younger sister Binny, who is dazzled by Julia's beauty. Binny gathers violets on a cold damp morning to make Julia a May basket, and is rewarded by a kiss from Julia, but the dampness brings on an attack of rheumatic fever and Binny dies. Johnny and Julia marry and have a son, Tucker, while Elsa marries Gib Evans and has a daughter, Jennifer, who becomes Tucker's close friend. Shortly after the turn of the century, Anne is widowed when John has an accident rushing to help a patient in bad weather, and subsequently dies of pneumonia. Julia's frigidity causes Johnny to have an affair with his Irish Catholic nurse, Norah O'Neill. Through Johnny, Norah's younger sister Ellen meets Ludwig and Sally's youngest son Paul. Ellen and Paul have a secret romance and Ellen becomes pregnant, resulting in Paul quietly marrying her with Ludwig's consent since he is underage. Although Paul and Ellen are happy, Sally disapproves of the marriage, cuts ties with her son and, in response to a barbed remark by Julia's mother Louisa, informs her about Johnny's affair with Norah. As a result, Julia divorces Johnny, moves to California with Tucker, and later marries a wealthy older man who is past the age of having sex. Johnny, suffering from heart disease and the strain of the divorce, soon dies. Anne and the other members of the Club are unaware that Sally was the one who revealed Johnny's affair to Louisa, and instead think Eliza spread the story. Sally eventually is reconciled with Paul after he and his family survive a devastating flood. Ludwig dies and his daughter Elsa takes over as president of the family-owned bank; she also succeeds her mother as president of the Club. Elsa's son Ludwig takes control of his grandfather's company after returning from his service in the Great War, where he was gassed. Tucker, separated from Jennifer by his parents' divorce, meets her again as an adult when they are both serving in France in the war, he as a medical corpsman and she as a nurse. After the war, they marry, and Tucker becomes a doctor and returns to take up his practice in Waynesboro. By the 1930s, Sally is suffering from arteriosclerosis and asks Elsa to bring Anne so that she can confess to Anne that she was the one who revealed Johnny's affair. Elsa talks her out of doing so, noting that Anne is happy with the company of Tucker, Jennifer and their children. As a result, Sally has a farewell visit with Anne but does not mention the situation involving Johnny. Sally dies soon afterwards. In 1932, right after Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected President, Anne, the last surviving founding member of the Club, dies and the Club commemorates the end of an era.\n\nCharacters\nDue to the length of the book and its large number of characters, this list is selective. † denotes a minor character.\n\nGordon/Deming/Stevens family\n\n* Anne Alexander Gordon – Valedictorian of her 1868 graduating class at Waynesboro Female College, she marries Dr. John Gordon and encourages him to resume practicing medicine.

The first two were published to little notice and the third was unpublished. She disliked Sinclair Lewis's negative portrayal of small town America in his novel, Main Street, and conceived of Ladies as an antidote. However, since she worked full-time, she was unable to write very much before her retirement in 1959. A collection of her nostalgic reminiscences of Xenia, Ohio was published as Ohio Town by Ohio State University Press in 1962. The director of the Press, Weldon Kefauver, encouraged her to write more. In 1976 she submitted eleven boxes containing bookkeeping ledgers, her manuscript of Ladies in longhand. Kefauver accepted the novel, but wanted it trimmed. By then, Santmyer was spending much of her time in a nursing home and she dictated changes to her friend Mildred Sandoe. The Press published the novel, printed 1500 copies and sold a few hundred, priced at $35, mostly to libraries. In 1983, Santmyer was forced for health reasons to move permanently into a nursing home. Ladies was awarded the 1983 Ohioana Book Award in the category of fiction, but otherwise gained little attention at the time.\n\nSuccess\nOne local library patron, in returning the book, told the librarian that it was the greatest novel she had ever read. Another patron, Grace Sindell, overheard this and checked the book out herself. After reading it, she agreed with the assessment and called her son Gerald in Hollywood. He was at first reluctant to look at the book, believing that anything that was that good would already be taken. Unable to find a copy in California, he ordered one directly from the publisher and agreed that it had great potential. He convinced his Hollywood friend Stanley Corwin of the same and the two purchased movie, TV and republication rights. They then convinced Putnam to republish the book. Before republication, the Book-of-the-Month club chose Ladies as their main selection. Suddenly, Santmyer and her novel were a media sensation, including front-page coverage in the New York Times. The paperback edition, published by Berkley in 1985, sold more than 2 million copies between June and September, making it the best-selling paperback in history at the time.\n\nReception\nMost reviews were enthusiastic. A few were grudging and even hostile.\n\nReferences\n" .

Beginning as an internationalist publication, after some numbers it dramatically changed its editorial line, rallying to the nationalist,  line of the magazine .\n\nHistory\nThe magazine was named \"900\" as it was conceived as part of the Novecento Italiano artistic movement. On its launch in 1926, it was received by \"a storm of discussion, almost all hostile\" by the strapaesano and fascist environment, but it had very important editors like Ramón Gómez de la Serna, James Joyce, Georg Kaiser, and Pierre Mac Orlan. The magazine was founded by Massimo Bontempelli and was based in Rome. Editorial officers were Corrado Alvaro, in Rome, and the Nino Frank from Paris. The first four preambles, Giustification, Basis, Advices, Analogies were published in French in the journals of autumn 1926, March and June 1927. (They were translated into Italian in 1938 by Bontempelli himself.) They set out the main principles of Novecentism, but later editions abandoned internationalism, were written exclusively in Italian, and switched to a patriotic, nationalist approach in line with Fascist policy. In three years only, \"900\" hosted the dadaist Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and the surrealist Soupault; it published, for the first time in Italy, translated paragraphs from Ulysses by James Joyce and from Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf; it published also a George Grosz profile written by Yvan Goll, inedited texts by Anton Chekhov and a short story by Tolstoy. Others who wrote for the magazine included Alberto Moravia and Ilya Ehrenburg. The magazine closed in June 1929.\n\nSee also\nList of magazines published in Italy\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"900\" article (in Italian) at the Archivio della Scuola Romana" .

It is added to overseas service ribbons to indicate the theatre of action. The Arctic \"A\" Device (with serifs), if authorized, may be attached to the center of the Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, for service beginning February 10, 2002. If an oak leaf cluster is also authorized for wear on the ribbon, the \"A\" device is worn to the wearer's right of any oak leaf clusters on the ribbon. The Atlantic \"A\" Device (without serifs), if authorized, may be attached to the center of the suspension and service ribbon of the American Defense Service Medal for service from June 22 to December 7, 1941. The \"A\" device is worn in lieu of any authorized ​3⁄16 inch bronze star that is worn on the medal and service ribbon.\n\nHistory\nThe \"A\" Device is only authorized for the currently in use Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, and the American Defense Service Medal which is no longer in use. The two representations of the \"A\" device are different. The Arctic Device has serifs while the Atlantic Device (\"Axis Device\") does not have \"feet\" (sans-serif).\n\nAtlantic Device (World War II)\nThe American Defense Service Medal was the first military award to use the \"A\" device which was named the \"Atlantic Device\" (sometimes was referred to as the \"Axis Device\"). The \"A\" device was authorized for wear (in lieu of a ​3⁄16 inch bronze star that was worn in lieu of a service clasp on the award) on the medal and service ribbon by any member of the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard who served on certain vessels in the Atlantic Ocean between June 22 and December 7, 1941 which engaged in armed conflict, or potential armed conflict, with Axis forces in the Atlantic (naval forces of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine). Such personnel were awarded the American Defense Service Medal with the \"Atlantic Device\" (Atlantic Fleet service), the intent being to recognize those who had participated in the \"undeclared war\" when the U.S. was assisting Britain with war convoys and German U-boat interdiction.\n\nArctic Device (USAF)\nThe \"A\" device became obsolete after the Second World War and did not appear again until the year 2002 (authorized on February 10, 2002). At that time, the United States Air Force declared that the \"A\" device, now known as the \"Arctic Device\", would be authorized for wear for those who had received the Air Force Overseas Ribbon - Short Tour, for tours of duty north of the Arctic Circle. As of February 8, 2007, only those airmen (Air Force active, Reserve, or Guard) who were assigned to Thule Air Base (north-east Greenland) qualify for the \"A\" (Arctic) device. Although portions of Alaska are within the Arctic Circle, there are no American military bases within that region. The \"A\" is worn on the center of the ribbon except when worn with oak leaf clusters. Whenever oak leaf clusters are authorized for wear on the ribbon, the \"A\" is placed to the wearer's right of the oak leaf clusters on the ribbon. Only one \"A\" device may be worn on the ribbon.\n\nSee also\n\n* Coast Guard Arctic Service Medal\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22A%22_Is_for_Alibi?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"A\" Is for Alibi is crime writer Sue Grafton's debut mystery novel in the Kinsey Millhone \"Alphabet mystery\" series, first published in 1982. The novel is set in the fictional southern California city of Santa Teresa, based on Santa Barbara. The choice of murder by substituting the contents of an antihistamine tablet with crushed oleander meant that an alibi held no value because the contents of the tablet could have been switched a considerable time earlier than the victim actually swallowed the tablet. Grafton says that she conceived aspects of the plot on her own \"fantasies\" of murdering her then-husband while going through a divorce.\n\nPlot summary\nKinsey Millhone, 32, private detective investigates the death of prominent divorce lawyer Laurence Fife. His murder eight years earlier was blamed on his wife, Nikki Fife. Upon being released from prison, Nikki hires Kinsey to find the real murderer. In the course of the investigation, Kinsey becomes involved with Charlie Scorsoni, the late Mr. Fife's former law partner. She discovers Fife's death has been linked to that of a woman in Los Angeles, his law firm's accountant; both died after taking poisonous oleander capsules, which had been substituted for allergy pills. Kinsey tracks down the accountant's parents and former boyfriend. She then goes to Las Vegas to interview Fife's former secretary, Sharon Napier, who is killed minutes before Kinsey arrives. Back in California, Kinsey is mystified that Nikki's son, Colin, recognizes Laurence's first wife, Gwen, in a photograph. Kinsey surmises that Gwen was having an affair with her ex-husband at the time of his death. She accuses Gwen, who confesses. Shortly afterwards, she too is dead, killed in a hit-and-run crash. Kinsey has solved the case she was hired to investigate; but in a plot twist, she discovers that her previous notions about the accountant's death were entirely wrong: in fact, it was Scorsoni who killed her when she discovered he was skimming dividend money from estate accounts under his management. Scorsoni used the same method that Gwen used to kill Fife, so it would be assumed the same person committed both murders. In a final confrontation, he chases Kinsey across the beach, armed with a knife. Kinsey hides in the shore line, and she is forced to remove her shoes and pants. Before Scorsoni can kill her, she shoots him dead. A secondary storyline involves Millhone's surveillance of Marcia Threadgill, suspected of insurance fraud in a trip-and-fall case. Although Millhone believes she has successfully documented Threadgill's deception, the insurance firm that contracted Millhone to investigate Threadgill moves to pay her claim anyway, citing potential legal costs and complications, including the risk of reprisal.\n\nDedication\nThe book is dedicated to Chip Grafton, the author's father, \"who set me on this path\". Chip Grafton was a municipal bond attorney in Kentucky who pursued a secondary career as a crime novelist, winning minor acclaim for four novels. He died on January 1, 1982 at age 72, four months before 'A' is for Alibi was published.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator hired by the wife of a man murdered years earlier, to find the real killer, after the wife is let out of prison, having been blamed for his death.\n\nReviews\nKirkus Reviews said this was a \"shakily plotted but otherwise terrific start for a new detective series\", writing when the book was released. They look forward to the rest of the Alphabet Series, \"fine dialogue, a great eye for people and places\", if the author can tighten up her plots. Looking back at the series soon after the author's death, Library Journal Reviews remarked on the slow build up to successful reviews, including a quote from its own review: \"Critic Sarah Weinman notes that pseudonymous New York Times critic Newgate Callendar dismissed A Is for Alibi as \"competent enough, but not particularly original.\" Alas, LJ's reviewer was equally unenthusiastic in an April 1, 1982, review, waving the book aside as \"nothing to take it out of the ordinary.\" Before those less enthusiastic words, they had said, \"The female detective is well drawn and the plot moves at a fast clip\".\n\nDevelopment of the novel\nGrafton relates that she conceived the story on her own \"fantasies\" of murdering her then husband while going through a divorce.\n\nPublication history\nThe first printing of \"A\" Is for Alibi was 7,500 copies, with initial sales of about 6,000.\n\nWriting style\nGrafton's style is characteristic of hardboiled detective fiction, according to the authors of 'G' is for Grafton, who describe it as \"laconic, breezy, wise-cracking\". The novel is framed as a report Kinsey writes in the course of her investigation, and written in the First-person narrative giving depth to the narrative.\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n* Kaufman, Natalie Hevener; Kay, Carol McGinnis (1997). \"G\" Is for Grafton: The World of Kinsey Millhone (Hardcover ed.).

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22All_God's_Children%22_Campaign?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The \"All God's Children\" Campaign is an effort by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) to challenge religious opposition to the legalization of same-sex marriage and promote LGBT acceptance in the Southern United States. According to the HRC, the program was designed to \"change hearts and minds, improve the public perception and overall awareness of LGBT people, begin to reduce the painful stigma that many face in their daily lives, and help future efforts to enact pro-equality legislation.\" The program targeted Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas – all states that had no form of housing, employment, or marriage protections for LGBT citizens.\n\nBackground\nThe United States south is far more culturally conservative than its northern counterpart. In the early 2000s, while northern states began legalizing same-sex marriage, many southern states were passing laws banning it. However, southern support as a whole rose an entire 26 percentage points from 2003 to 2013, leaving the south currently split about evenly on the issue of same-sex marriage. Scholars suggest that some of the factors leading to this cultural change include generational differences, the \"friends and family effect,\" and a new appreciation for the separation of church and state. Approximately 64% of Southerners can say that they know someone who is gay or lesbian, a factor that is considered crucial for support of legislation such as same-sex marriage. Even so, with a score of 55, the south holds the lowest regional social climate index score for the LGBT community in the United States. Same-sex couples with kids have a household income that averages about $11,000 lower than heterosexual couples. Gay and bisexual men in the south hold higher HIV infection rates than those in other parts of the country; additionally, only ​3⁄475% of southern LGBT people are covered by health insurance. \"Discomfort\" with exposure to LGBT lifestyles, such as attending a same-sex wedding or seeing pictures of a coworker with a same-sex partner, polls about 5-10 percentage points higher in the South than in northern states. Additionally, the chosen states are heavily religious; for example, more than half of Mississippi residents are members of the southern Baptist church. Because of this, the Human Rights Campaign refers to Mississippi, their target audience for the early stages of the All God's Children campaign, as being \"the most religious state in America.\" Mississippi also has no statewide protects for LGBT people and, in 2014, passed a law allowing businesses to refuse services to LGBT people.\n\nStrategy\nThe \"All God's Children\" project included phone banking, TV commercials, banner ads, and \"direct-mail\" messages. The ad campaign featured testimonies from Christian parents of LGBT children, gay army veterans, and transgender students to appeal towards the religious community. The Mississippi campaign itself was expected to cost approximately $310,000, out of a total of $8.5 million including Alabama and Arkansas over the course of three years. The first television commercials aired in November 2014 in Mississippi, two days before a federal court hearing on a state law banning same-sex marriage.\n\nResponse\nThe American Family Association of Mississippi, however, issued a retaliatory statement in November [2014] arguing that the \"[normalization of] homosexuality in the southern states\" would not be acceptable to their program. Others argued that the campaign wouldn't be enough to change the hearts of \"biblically literate Christians.\" Southern Protestants, especially those in the Southern Baptist Convention, are alleged to be the most vehemently opposed to the expansion of LGBT protections in the south.\n\nReferences\n" .

It has been subsequently popularised by former Conservative Party aide Tim Montgomerie, the former editor of ConservativeHome, who has written on its usage. It has also been used in the United States where it has been picked up by publications such as The Weekly Standard that considered its implications for the Republican Party. The term has been defined in the United States by The Okklahoma Gazette as follows: The idea is that a center-right party needs not abandon its core issues - crime, taxes, family. Rather, the wise course is to hold fast on those issues and speak to concerns normally ceded to the left.\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nThe \"And\" theory has been embraced by several leading conservative politicians in the United Kingdom, including the former Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister David Cameron (although the term the \"And\" theory tends not to be expressly mentioned due to its clunky and potentially confusing name). When challenging for the leadership of the party, Cameron said: When we talk about foreign affairs, we don't just stand up for Gibraltar and Zimbabwe but for the people of Darfur and sub-Saharan Africa who are living on less than a dollar a day and getting poorer while we're getting richer. Cameron therefore encouraged Conservatives to be concerned with the former British Empire territory of Zimbabwe and the situation in Darfur. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith has continued to promote \"And\" politics, most notably in his 2005 pamphlet Good for Me, Good for My Neighbour, written with Danny Kruger: I have never believed that modernisation requires the jettisoning of Conservative Euroscepticism, or of our belief in low taxation, or of our tough approach to crime. These principles remain enduringly popular with the public. My proposal for the modernisation of the Party is not to subtract from these core principles – but to add to them. Duncan Smith has encouraged the party to embrace a social justice agenda (traditionally associated with the left) based on a commitment to the family (seen as an issue of the right).\n\nSee also\n\n* British one nation conservatism and Canadian Red Toryism, older similar theories \n* Centre for Social Justice, main \"And\" conservative organisation \n* Communitarianism \n* Conservatism \n* Conservative Party (UK) which has a strong \"And\" conservative faction \n* Compassionate conservatism, similar philosophy in both United Kingdom and United States\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22As_the_Old_Sing,_So_Pipe_the_Young%22_(Jan_Steen)?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "Soo voer gesongen, soo na gepepen is a c.1668–1670 oil-on-canvas painting (H 133.7 cm × W 162.5 cm) by Dutch artist Jan Steen, that is currently featured in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. The painting is a celebratory holiday scene that depicts three generations of a Dutch family, and serves as an allegory about parental examples, vice, and influence. This subject has been painted thirteen times by Jan Steen and has also been known as The Cat Family, or Jan Steen's Family. Of the many renditions, the Mauritshuis version is considered to be the exemplar of the series.\n\nSubject matter\nThe holiday scene depicts the proverb of \"As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young\" and deliberately alludes to the fact the elders in a family have certain traits that recur in subsequent generations. Inherited traits were viewed by the Dutch people at the time as being a two-sided coin, where a child would inherit genetic traits from their parents, but would also learn to emulate the behaviors that they witnessed. This is also referred to as nature versus nurture. The depiction of three generations of family members in this scene is a direct allusion to this idea, with the parents providing seemingly poor examples to their children by drinking alcoholic beverages and encouraging the children to smoke. The title can also be interpreted as \"Like father, like son.\"  Such proverbs were popular in Dutch painting and are represented by many paintings by Steen and other artists. This painting has been linked to Steen's work titled The Twelfth Night Feast, the two paintings forming a diptych of the same theme. The theme is thought to be inspired by Jacob Jordaens, a contemporary Flemish painter. Jordaen's version preceded Steen's, having been painted in the year 1683. Like Jordaens, Steen paired proverbs with merry company paintings, which was popular and served a didactic purpose for the viewer.\n\nDescription\nAs a genre scene, the painting contains many iconographic elements that are open to the viewer's interpretation and ideas that relate to Dutch popular culture of the time. The painting consists of a gathering of family members (parents, children, grandparents) around a table that is draped with a carpet typical of Dutch scenes. Though the subject has been painted by Steen an estimated thirteen times, each one was depicted in a household setting as the theme for child rearing and parental interaction. Like most of Steen's paintings As the Old Sing... is of the merry company genre and depicts family life as a part of popular culture during the 17th century. Paintings of this particular period are commonly festive scenes in Dutch domestic settings. The large canvas displays Steen's mastery of painting light on surfaces, as can be seen in the treatment of light from the window reflected onto the surfaces of the models' clothing and furniture accents. The facial features of the subjects are painted in a realistic style with attention to light and shadow. The overall scene of the merry atmosphere is thought to be open and inviting with the figures situated in an open arrangement, with warm colors of orange, pink, purple, and brown; while casually enjoying themselves. The old lady in the foreground, thought to be Steen's mother, is holding a sheet of music that is open and can be easily read by the viewer. Steen is distinguished as a skilled comic painter and for depicting himself in his paintings, as well as members of his own family. Here he has depicted himself as the father seen in the right side of the canvas who is teaching his younger son to smoke a pipe. Such a painting was thought by the artist to have universal appeal and understanding, but of course, it would have had more resonance with a well-read person familiar with the proverbs, symbolism, and culture of the seventeenth century. Ironically, Steen's knowledge of such readings and traditions is considered to be rather sophisticated.\n\nSymbolism\nThe figures in the scene are Steen at the right wearing a black hat and teaching his younger son to smoke, his older son playing a bagpipe, a young girl at the far right edge of the canvas, Steen's mother in the right-side foreground, and an unknown female family member holding a baby. There is also a male servant at the rear center who is pouring an alcoholic drink into the glass of Steen's wife, who is pictured at the left of the canvas wearing a green coat and lavender skirt with her glass outstretched. There is a dog in the foreground. At the center of the table is an oyster which has been a popular symbol in Dutch genre painting. The oyster has been known as a symbol of Aphrodite, love, fertility, and sexual pleasure. The symbol is befitting of such as scene as it is associated with foods served at a feast of the gods. The oyster was commonly depicted in Dutch genre paintings up until the year 1635 when it became less common. After the year 1660 the symbol again became a common theme as it is here in Steen's 1668–1670 painting. In the painting the woman in the lavender skirt sitting at the left is a depiction of Steen's wife. She and Steen both wear a pink ribbon, she in her hair, and he on his hat. This ribbon is a unifying element between the two and represents their being cut from the same spool of ribbon. The parrot situated at the top left of the painting is a symbol of mimicry. To the left of the parrot is a pair of birds in a small birdcage which symbolizes two parents in a small abode. The pipe in the scene may have multiple meanings referring to a clay smoking pipe, the act of singing, or to a drinking vessel.According to the Dutch, the bagpipe was not an esteemed instrument as it was thought to be lowly and obnoxious. Such a symbol here represents bawdiness and low class, which is being encouraged by the parents. The young man playing the bagpipe is an older son of Steen. The laughing face of Jan Steen is commonly depicted by the artist in his paintings and is considered to be his iconography while laughter is also thought to be a symbol of foolishness and or fault. A reader might interpret the many laughing faces as gained wisdom, human fault, or lessons learned. Steen's iconographic grin has become somewhat of a folk character to museum patrons who delight in seeing his face in paintings.\n\nCulture\nSteen has been detailed by historians as being from a middle-class, Catholic family of Leiden, who was also preoccupied with drinking and imprudent of his finances. Historical accounts state that Steen's father owned a brewery but also suggest that the brewery business became less profitable due to economic demands and competition. As a result, Steen was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in painting, which was a respected profession of the time. From his experience as a painter Steen endured constant fluctuations of financial difficulty. As a painter he often depicted himself within his comical scenes to show himself immersed in the culture he depicted and is also as an allusion to the idea that art imitates life. Steen was a resident of The Hague where he married Margariet or Grietje, and also became a member of The Hague Guild. As a member of the guild Steen is thought to have pursued comic painting as the path to a chosen specialization.\n\nPatronage\nSteen is considered to have been a fixture in Leiden, with most of his commissions coming from familial connections and recommendations. Historical records indicate patrons numbering above one hundred, with some owners directly inheriting the works. Patrons tended to be members of respectable professions including doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, manufacturers, and an innkeeper. The presence of Steen's likeness in his paintings has been a dealbreaker for some patrons and it has also functioned as a signature.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n*" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Awaken,_My_Love!%22?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Awaken, My Love!\" is the third studio album by American rapper Donald Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino. It was released by Glassnote Records on December 2, 2016. Consisting of tracks being sung rather than rapped, its fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and R&B influences was considered a bold departure from the predominantly hip hop style of his prior work. The album was produced by Glover and his longtime collaborator, Ludwig Göransson. \"Awaken, My Love!\" received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200. The album was supported by three singles, \"Me and Your Mama\", \"Redbone\" and \"Terrified\". It received Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards. The single \"Redbone\" also earned nominations for Record of the Year, Best R&B Song, and won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\n\nBackground\nOn June 17, 2016, after a hiatus from social media, Glover tweeted \"pharos.earth\", a link to download his new app. The app itself placed the user in outer space looking at a small blue planet while a clock counted down to zero. The app then had the user crash down into space, placing them on a map that was located on Joshua Tree, California. The app then showed the dates of his upcoming performances in Joshua Tree, where the user could also purchase tickets. The concert festival was to debut the album and give the audience the \"full-album experience\". From September 3 to 5, nearly three months before the release of his album, Glover held three concert performances at Joshua Tree to debut the album. Glover wore glow-in-the-dark paint on his braids and a pink and yellow skirt, with his bandmates wearing similar attire. He performed eleven songs during the concert with minimal rapping, mainly featuring a funk/jazz vibe. Upon its release, Glover updated his Pharos app so users could watch the performance of his first lead single, \"Me and Your Mama\" at Joshua Tree through a virtual reality lens on the phone.\n\nCover artwork\nThe cover of \"Awaken, My Love!\" features a photo by New York City-based creative director Ibra Ake, in which model Giannina Oteto wears a beaded headdress designed by Laura Wass of WXYZ Jewelry. Prior to the album's release, the cover artwork was included as an easter egg in the episode \"Juneteenth\" of Glover's FX series Atlanta.\n\nSingles\n\"Me and Your Mama\" was released as the album's lead single on Beats 1 radio and the iTunes Store on November 10, 2016, while \"Redbone\" was released a week later, premiering on Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1. On September 19, 2017, \"Terrified\" was sent to urban contemporary radio as the album's third single.\n\nCritical reception\n\"Awaken, My Love!\" was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 77, based on 25 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Mosi Reeves of Rolling Stone wrote that \"'Awaken, My Love!' is an enthralling trip into the land of funk,\" while Dan Bogosian from The A.V. Club wrote \"Is Childish Gambino suddenly the new Prince, a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist always ready to keep the world an arm’s length away from knowing what he's thinking? Is he D'Angelo, a soul god fighting against his first image with all-time great music? No. He is Donald Glover, a man who can perform and write comedy, act in drama, and drop a truly wonderful album on short notice with all the influences and instructions spelled out.\" Perry Kostidakis of the FSView & Florida Flambeau wrote that \"with each successive album, Childish Gambino has exhibited phenomenal growth, but no more than on his latest release. Unflinchingly ambitious and boldly different, 'Awaken, My Love' calls back the sounds and themes of the 1970s funkadelic movement to provide a wholly original, emotional and immersive musical experience,\" with The Guardian's Gwilym Mumford adding \"only the limitations of his voice occasionally let him down – he doesn't quite have the range to nail Awaken's more ostentatious vocal lines. Still, it's a minor gripe when there's so much here to enjoy.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, \"It's at once a homage and a parody, equally aware of that era's excesses and its glories, of the way that the most memorable 1970s R&B merged sensuality, activism, humor, toughness, outlandishness, futurism, soul roots, wild eccentricity and utopian community spirit. That's an extremely high bar, but at its best, 'Awaken, My Love!' recalls many of those virtues.\" Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, \"'Awaken, My Love!' is a stone-cold blast from beginning to end.\" Matthew Strauss of Pitchfork said, \"There are times, however, when that nodding feels more like mimicry than anything else. Maybe he'll figure out how to smuggle Donald Glover's heart into Childish Gambino's brain eventually, but if he hasn't figured out what he wants out of Childish Gambino yet, it's increasingly rewarding watching him try.\" Scott Glaysher of XXL said, \"Childish Gambino gets definite props for pushing the envelope and refusing to operate within any genre confinements on this refreshing 49-minute trip through the funkadelic 1970s. While these blurred lines make this album a little hard to follow, 'Awaken, My Love!' proves his versatility as a rapper turning over a new leaf.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer said, \"Throughout, Glover's genre fluency is unimpeachable; the only minor drawback is the overmannered air of some of these period pieces, where there could be more straight-up abandon, as on the persuasive 'Me and Your Mama'.\" Robert Christgau regarded the album as \"a seriously overrated piece of romantic P-Funk retro that owes its Grammy nomination to Atlanta\".\n\nAccolades\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nCommercial performance\n\"Awaken, My Love!\" debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200 with 101,000 album-equivalent units, marking the third highest debut of the week. It was the fourth best-selling album of the week, selling 72,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was also streamed 41.5 million times in the first week. It is Glover's highest-charting album. As of December 28, 2016, the album has sold 151,000 album-equivalent units, with 100,000 in physical album sales.

Elaine was last seen getting into a cab with the intention of flying down to Boca Raton, Florida, where she spends her winters, but appears to have disappeared along the way. It seems a relatively straightforward matter, so much so that Millhone is not sure Beverly needs a PI; but she agrees to take the case. Things are not as easy as they seem, however, as Millhone can find no trace of Elaine anywhere in Florida, although she does find a woman called Pat Usher, who claims Elaine agreed to let her sublet the Boca Raton apartment where Elaine lived while she was off travelling. This claim rings false, since no one but Pat Usher has received a postcard from Elaine on her supposed trip. Millhone secures the able assistance of Elaine's elderly neighbour, Julia, to keep an eye on things in Florida while she goes back to California. Millhone suspects there is a link between Elaine's disappearance and the death of her Santa Teresa neighbour, Marty Grice, who was apparently killed by a burglar who then set fire to the Grice home a week before Elaine left. Someone breaks into the home of Tillie, the supervisor of Elaine's Santa Teresa apartment complex, apparently on the track of some of Elaine's bills that Tillie was holding ready to forward to her. Someone also searches the detective's apartment, and Millhone realizes the thief is after Elaine’s passport. Gravely concerned for Elaine's safety, Millhone suggests to Beverly that Elaine's disappearance should be reported to the police; but Beverly objects so violently that Millhone terminates their relationship and starts working for Julia instead. Kinsey reports the disappearance and meets Jonah Robb, a recently separated cop working on missing persons. A visit from Beverly's husband Aubrey complicates matters further, as it turns out he was having an affair with Elaine, which Beverly had discovered. This raises suspicion around whether Beverly could have had a hand in Elaine's disappearance. Millhone is increasingly convinced that Elaine is dead and that Pat Usher is involved. Pat disappears after totally trashing the Boca Raton apartment. Eventually, Millhone discovers that Pat Usher has applied for a driving licence in Elaine's name, thus proving Pat's involvement. Marty's nephew Mike, a teenage drug dealer, confesses that he was at the Grice home the night of the murder; and from the discrepancy in times between his account and what was told to the police, Kinsey realises that it was Elaine who died in the Grice fire, not Marty. Marty and her husband killed Elaine to steal her identity (which Marty assumed) and her money. They then passed Elaine's dead body off as Marty's by switching the dental records. Marty departed for Florida as Elaine and arrived as Pat Usher, with some cosmetic surgery to help. Unable to find Elaine's passport, she and her husband were forced to wait for a new one to come through before they can skip the country. Kinsey returns to the Grice home to look for the murder weapon; but while she is there, the Grices find her. Marty Grice is shot in the left arm during the fight that ensues, but Kinsey manages to detain the two criminals and calls for help.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective hired to find a missing woman.\n\nReviews\n\n\nAwards\n\"B\" Is for Burglar was awarded the 1986 Anthony Award for Best Novel at Bouchercon, the World Mystery Convention, in Baltimore, Maryland.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Babbacombe%22_Lee?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Babbacombe\" Lee is the seventh album by English folk rock group Fairport Convention. Released in 1971, it tells the life story of John Babbacombe Lee, a Victorian-era alleged murderer who was condemned to death but reprieved after the gallows failed on three occasions to work properly. After the commercial and chart success of its predecessor, Angel Delight, the album sold disappointingly, and although critically acclaimed, it has its place in musical history as the first \"folk rock opera\".\n\nConcept\nThe album is a concept album that follows John \"Babbacombe\" Lee's life story. The events of his life are described in song, from his boyhood through his conviction for murder, sentence of death, and the failure to carry out the sentence. The songs describe his boyhood poverty, his time in the Royal Navy, and his being invalided out. The album then describes how Lee went to work in the service of a Miss Keyes. While Lee was in her service, she was murdered, and he was accused, tried and convicted of the crime, and sentenced to death; however, when authorities attempted to hang him, the gallows failed three times, resulting in his release. These events are all told in song, and all but one of those songs are originals. Dave Swarbrick has explained that he conceived the album after discovering a file of old newspaper clippings in a junk shop; this file contained John Lee's own copies of the newspaper articles and was bound by him, signed and dated 30 January 1908. Because of its relatively complete narrative structure, \"Babbacombe\" Lee has been called a rock opera, and because of the band's musical style, in particular the first folk rock opera.\n\nTrack listing\nSongs written by Fairport Convention The original album listed tracks episodically rather than as discrete tracks, reflecting the structure of the narrative. Each of the five sections is composed of a number of songs and fragments of songs that were not listed separately on the original album.\n\n2004 Compact Disc listing\nThe later release of the album abandoned the original five-part division of the album and lists the songs as separate tracks complete with songwriting credits, as follows: 1.  \n* \"The Verdict\" (read by Philip Sterling-Wall)  – 0:28 2.  \n* \"Little Did I Think\" (Dave Swarbrick) – 2:19 3.  \n* \"I Was Sixteen (Part 1)\" (Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg) – 1:29 4.  \n* \"John My Son\" (Nicol, Pegg) – 0:44 5.  \n* \"I Was Sixteen (Part 2)\" (Nicol, Pegg) – 1:17 6.  \n* \"St Ninian's Isle\" (Ronald Cooper) / Trumpet Hornpipe (Traditional; arranged by Swarbrick) – 1:14 7.  \n* \"Sailor's Alphabet\" (Traditional; arranged by A.L. Lloyd) – 5:50 8.  \n* \"John Lee\" (Swarbrick) – 3:04 9.  \n* \"Newspaper Reading (read by A.L. Lloyd) – 0:46 10.  \n* \"Breakfast in Mayfair\" (Nicol) – 3:09 11.  \n* \"Trial Song\" (Swarbrick, Pegg) – 3:55 12.  \n* \"Cell Song\" (Swarbrick) – 3:35 13.  \n* \"The Time Is Near\" (Pegg) – 2:31 14.  \n* \"Dream Song\" (Swarbrick, Pegg) – 5:24 15.  \n* \"Wake Up John (Hanging Song)\" (Swarbrick, Pegg) – 5:25 Two additional bonus tracks appear on some post-2004 CD releases: 1.  \n* \"Farewell to a Poor Man's Son\" (Swarbrick)  – 4:55 2.  \n* \"Breakfast In Mayfair\" (Nicol) 3:59 These tracks were recorded in late 1974 for the BBC 2 documentary about John Lee narrated by Melvyn Bragg. The programme was broadcast in the BBC 2 2nd House series as \"The Man They Couldn't Hang – John Lee\" on 1 February 1975. Personnel: Dave Swarbrick, Dave Pegg, Dave Mattacks, Jerry Donahue, Simon Nicol (although he not in the band at this time, Nicol made a brief return for this one-off project), with, for one song, the newly returned Sandy Denny.\n\n2011 \"Babbacombe\" Lee Live Again\nIn 2011, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original album, Fairport performed \"Babbacombe\" Lee in its entirety on both their Winter Tour and at the Cropredy Festival in August. The performance was released as a CD & digital download in 2012.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Baby_Lollipops%22_murder?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The \"Baby Lollipops\" murder was the murder of three-year-old Lazaro Figueroa by his mother Ana Maria Cardona, in Florida. The body of Lazaro was found abandoned, and identified through house-to-house inquiries. The case was widely covered in US media, who called the initially unidentified boy \"Baby Lollipops\", after the design on the T-shirt he was wearing when found. Cardona was arrested for the murder and sentenced to death; her girlfriend, Olivia Gonzalez, was sentenced to forty years. On a second appeal Cardona was sentenced to life in prison. Gonzalez was released after 14 years.\n\nBackground\nLazaro Figueroa was born on September 18, 1987 to Ana Maria Cardona and Fidel Figueroa. Cardona also had two older children. Fidel Figueroa was a well-known drug dealer and died under mysterious circumstances on September 20, 1987. This crime remains unsolved. In November 1990, Lazaro Figueroa's body was discovered in front of a beach property in Miami Beach. He had been severely battered, which made it initially very difficult for authorities to identify him. Because Lazaro's remains were unidentified for weeks after his discovery, local news outlets nicknamed him \"Baby Lollipops\" in reference to the shirt he was found wearing. The cause of death was later determined to be a blow to the head from a baseball bat. Trial evidence showed that shortly after leaving Lazaro's body in the bushes, the couple fled to Central Florida, even making a stop at Disney World. Despite claims by neighbors and other individuals that Cardona was abusive towards Lazaro, she consistently denied it. Her main defense was that it was Olivia Gonzalez, her lover, who had beaten Lazaro and delivered the fatal blow with a baseball bat. Cardona attested that she wanted to escape the pain of her son's horrible beatings at her girlfriend's hands and so sank into cocaine use to cope. To support claims on the influence of her past in the case, her defense presented the court with evidence pertaining to her unsettled Cuban upbringing and the psychological devastation caused by the death of Lazaro's father. According to prosecutor Reid Rubin, however, Cardona was \"angry and spiteful\" from the death of her wealthy husband as she had lost a luxurious lifestyle. Gonzalez, however, was able to state her case against Cardona in exchange for a lighter 40-year sentence on the count of second-degree murder. She served 14 years. While admitting she played a role in her girlfriend's abuse of Lazaro, she was able to lay the majority of the blame on Cardona for Lazaro's eventual death.\n\nDiscovery\nEmployees for the Florida Power & Light Company discovered Lazaro Figueroa's dead body on the morning of November 2, 1990 at Miami Beach, hidden beneath some bushes. The boy was so emaciated that he appeared skeletal, with a bruised right eye. He wore blue gym shorts over a soiled diaper wrapped multiple times with brown packaging tape. At the time of his murder, Lazaro's weight was 18 pounds (8.16 kg), half the weight of a healthy child his age. The t-shirt he was wearing caused the Miami Beach Police Department to name him “Baby Lollipops,” and he remained unidentified for weeks after his discovery. The Miami Beach Police Department hosted a media conference with multiple detectives handling the murder case. They also conducted door-to-door interviews in both English and Spanish to obtain more information about the boy. They received numerous leads and were eventually able to identify the boy as Lazaro Figueroa, son of Ana Maria Cardona and the late Fidel Figueroa .\n\nPhysical injuries and autopsy\nThe autopsy revealed that Lazaro had a fresh tear to his corpus callosum as the result of a head injury that occurred hours to days before he died. The police concluded that he died from a fractured skull, later known to be the a result of a baseball bat blow. He was also starved and beaten, with a cigarette burn on his left cheek, broken teeth, broken bones, and bedsores from being bound to a mattress for extended periods. His diaper was caked with excrement and attached to his body with brown packing tape, and his arm was permanently fixed at 90 degrees. Weighing only 18 pounds at the time of his death, Lazaro was malnourished, anaemic, and dehydrated. The majority of his body bore bruises and scars, which were the result of longstanding injuries from the months preceding his death. Evidence presented at the trials demonstrated that Lazaro experienced 18 months of torture while he was alive․ Medical data demonstrated repeated occurrences of severe abuse resulting in an arm fracture and skull fractures with underlying subdural and subarachnoid hematomas. His two upper front teeth also appeared to be knocked out. Medical examiner Dr. Bruce Hyma testified that Lazaro's physical injuries were inflicted upon him over a long period, and that he had been subject to gagging and repeated starvation.\n\nTrials\n\n\nFirst trial\nAt her first trial in 1992, Cardona claimed her girlfriend at the time, Olivia Gonzalez, was the one who tortured Lazaro, eventually causing his death. Acquaintances of Ana Maria Cardona testified against her by recounting how she had consistently treated Lazaro poorly. Gonzalez, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 40 years and served 14 years. Gonzalez testified that on the \"last day of October\" (the last day before Lazaro's death), Cardona \"got pissed off and she hit [Lazaro] with a bat over the head\" because he was slow in taking off his diaper. She stated that Cardona hit Lazaro until \"[a] hole was opened up in his head. His head was cracked.\" Gonzalez explained that the wound \"started bleeding and bleeding and bleeding, and then I put mercury on it and I applied a plastic band.\" Throughout the trial, Cardona labelled Gonzalez as a \"murderer\" and as a \"monster\" who forced her to succumb to a sexual relationship with her in exchange for food and shelter for herself and her children. Defense attorney Steven Yermish remarked, \"She was in an abusive relationship she viewed as inescapable because she was being provided for.\" Judge David L. Tobin described Lazaro's long-standing abuse as the most \"heinous, atrocious or cruel of all times.\" Cardona was found guilty of first-degree murder as well as aggravated child abuse. She received a sentence of death based on the condition of her son's body, becoming the first woman to be sent to death row in Florida.\n\nSecond trial\nIn 2002, Cardona's initial sentence was overturned due to a Brady violation by the prosecution team, who had failed to allow defense attorneys access to interviews with Gonzalez, and the Florida Supreme Court granted her a second trial. At the second trial in 2010, prosecutors focused their attention on Lazaro's physical condition and the abuse he had suffered at the hands of his mother. In the second trial, a mentally-handicapped 14-year-old girl, Gloria Pi from Miami Beach, provided a detailed confession of throwing Lazaro against a wall. As a result, Cardona's legal defense team attempted to shift the blame of Lazaro's murder from Cardona to the girl. During the trial, Pi retracted her confession and maintained that she was innocent, emphasizing that she had never cared for or met Lazaro when the defense posited that in the days leading up to his death, Pi was looking after him. The jury requested that the confession be reread during their deliberation for the verdict. However, the jurors discounted Pi's testimony because there was not enough evidence to suggest that Lazaro ever stayed at Pi's residence. Kathleen Pautler described the confession as a \"diversionary tactic\" used by Cardona's defense team. Miami-Dade jurors again found Cardona guilty of the two counts, and in 2011, she was sentenced to death a second time. In contrast to her outrage at the verdict in the 1992 trial, Cardona appeared collected when her sentence was handed down. State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle stated, \"Almost 20 years later, a second jury heard the evidence and has come to the same conclusion...The truth still remains the truth.\" While reading her sentence, the judge, Reemberto Diaz stated, \"Ana Maria Cardona, you have forfeited your right to live... Lazaro was tortured to death.\"\n\nThird trial\nCardona spent 17 years on death row before her verdict was overturned by a higher court because the prosecution had used arguments that \"improperly inflamed the minds and passions of the jurors.\" The prosecution in the third trial did not seek the death penalty. In her third trial in 2017, a neighbor testified, \"She closed the door...it didn't appear that any lights were on but the shower was going and he was screaming.\" She stated that Lazaro was \"very small, very thin, very frail.\" However, Cardona insisted under oath that she did not inflict significant abuse on her son or break any of his bones. She also continued to recant her 1990 statement that Lazaro fell off the bed and hit his head, causing the tear in his corpus callosum. Instead, she placed the blame on her ex-girlfriend Olivia Gonzalez, insisting that she struck Lazaro with a baseball bat. Defence said they would introduced evidence Gonzalez had confessed to hitting the boy with the baseball bat and killing him. Cardona's lawyer, Stephen Yermish, attempted to persuade the jury that while she was indeed a bad mother, she was not necessarily a murderer. He conceded that \"the charge of aggravated child abuse may have been proven,\" but that the \"charge of murder has not.\" The jury found Ana Maria Cardona guilty of the death of Lazaro Figueroa in 1990, and the court convicted her of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse for a third time. However, this time she was sentenced to life in prison instead of a death sentence. Presiding Judge Miguel de la O remarked, “there are wild beasts that show more empathy for their offspring than you showed Lazaro.”\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Believing_Women%22_in_Islam?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Believing Women\" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an is a 2002 book by Asma Barlas, published by the University of Texas Press. According to Barlas, the Qur'an does not support patriarchy and modern day Muslims were not properly interpreting the text. She argues that the Qur'an supports equal spousal and marital rights and does not differentiate among sex and gender. Barlas attributes incorrect interpretations of the Qur'an to the hadith, shariah, and sunnah. Barlas stated that men were mostly the ones who had developed shariah.\n\nBackground\nAs of 2002, Barlas was the head of the Ithaca College Department of Politics, and the interim director of the college's Center for the Study of Culture, Race, and Ethnicity. She is a Muslim and believes the Qur'an is of divine origin.\n\nContent\nKristin Zahra Sands of the New York University Department of Middle Eastern Studies described the book as a Quranic exigesis rather than being an eternal study of exigesis. Barlas criticizes the traditional use of the hadith (sayings of Muhammed, not in the Quran) and tafsir (interpretation of the Quran), texts she sees as important to the misogynistic customs and beliefs in contemporary Islam, in Part I; these texts are often used together with the Qur'an in Islam. She advocates using itjihad (informed independent thought). The author has criticized some English translations of the Qur'an, and she argued that the document may be explored in any language. The main references used for the portions regarding the traditions of the Quran and tafsir are secondary sources and English translations. Sands described \"Believing Women\" as \"Building particularly on the work of Fazlur Rahman and Farid Esack\".\n\nReception\nSands argued that the book is \"an interesting contribution to contemporary Muslim thought that will be useful in teaching a broad range of undergraduate and graduate courses.\" Sands stated that due to the book's use of Islamic and feminist terminology, it would be best used \"selectively\" in introductory classes. Sands argued that the book should have been \"engaging more fully with the Arabic interpretative tradition\" and that the book should not criticize a translation if it accurately reflects the original Arabic. Jane I. Smith of the Hartford Seminary stated that the book was \"a well-constructed and thoughtfully written work, the arguments clearly developed and the prose a pleasure to read.\" Carolyn M. Craft of Longwood University wrote that the book is important for larger public libraries and academic libraries, and that it complements  by Amina Wadud.\n\nReferences\n\n* Craft, Carolyn M.

Edwards was active in the Chicago area of the United States. There is very little biographical information published on Edwards' life. Edwards played the tiple, a ten-stringed instrument, and was the only recorded blues tiple player during the period he was active. Edwards was also proficient on the guitar. Contemporary blues musician Big Bill Broonzy recalled working with Edwards, as well as Edwards working with Papa Charlie Jackson. Prolific session pianist Black Bob also recorded with Edwards on several of his later records. Edwards' song \"Louise\", recorded in 1934, was covered by Broonzy as \"Louise Louise Blues\".\n\nRecordings\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Edwards recorded 23 songs for the Vocalion, Melotone, Bluebird, Brunswick, and Decca record labels. Edwards was given several pseudonyms by the record companies that issued his recordings; these included \"Teddy Edwards\", \"\"Big Boy\" Teddy Edwards\", and \"Eddy Teddy\". Edwards' 1930 and 1931 records differ from his later output, singing with a simple tiple accompaniment. All of Edwards' sessions after this show him in a band setting with more of a pop music style, being accompanied by Big Bill Broonzy, Black Bob, and others.\n\n1930\nRecorded July 21, 1930 \n* \"Them Things\" \n* \"Family Trouble\" Recorded September 19, 1930 \n* \"I Ain't Gonna Give You None\" \n* \"Lovin' Blues\" Recorded December 12, 1930 \n* \"Alcohol Mama\"\n\n1931\nRecorded February 4, 1931 \n* \"Wild Woman Blues\"\n\n1934\nRecorded June 14, 1934 \n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 1) \n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 2) \n* \"I'm Gonna Tell My Mama On You\" \n* \"Louise\" \n* \"Love Will Provide For Me\" \n* \"If I Had A Girl Like You\" Recorded October 18, 1934 \n* \"Good Doing Daddy\" (Take 1) \n* \"Good Doing Daddy\" (Take 2) \n* \"It Was No Dream\" \n* \"Louise\" \n* \"Dancing The Blues Away\" \n* \"Hoodoo Blues\" \n* \"Run Away Blues\" Recorded October 24, 1934 \n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 1) \n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 2)\n\n1936\nRecorded May 15, 1936 \n* \"W.P.A Blues\" \n* \"Louisiana\"\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Discogs Page" .

While there, she meets Bobby Callahan, a twenty-three-year-old who was nearly killed when his car went off the road nine months ago. Bobby is convinced that the car crash, which killed his friend Rick, was an attempt on his life. He suspects that he may still be in danger, so he hires Kinsey to investigate. Having lost some of his memories and cognitive faculties as a result of the crash, he can only vaguely articulate why he thinks someone wants to kill him, referring to some information in a red address book that he can no longer locate. Kinsey takes the case despite little information, having taken a liking to Bobby. She meets his rich but dysfunctional family: Glen, his mother is an heiress on her third marriage to Derek Wenner, whose daughter Kitty is a 17-year-old drug user and is seriously ill with anorexia. Glen has spared no expense in seeking treatment and counseling for Bobby. He is depressed further due to Rick's death, his own injuries, and the loss of his prospects at medical school. A few days later, Bobby dies in another car crash, which is attributed to a seizure while driving. Kinsey thinks this is the delayed result of the first crash and thus a successful murder. Kinsey investigates several people: Kitty stands to inherit 2 million dollars from Bobby's will; Derek insured Bobby's life for a large sum without Glen's knowledge; and Rick's parents blame Bobby for their son's death. However, Kinsey looks elsewhere for the solution: a friend of Bobby's gives her Bobby's address book, which shows Bobby was searching for someone called Blackman. Bobby's former girlfriend thought Bobby ended their relationship because he was having an affair with someone else, and she thinks Bobby was helping a woman who was being blackmailed. Kinsey eventually finds out that the woman with whom Bobby was involved was his mother's friend, Nola Fraker. She confesses to having accidentally shot her husband, a well-known architect named Dwight Costigan, during a supposed struggle with an intruder at their home years prior. She has a blackmailer, who is in possession of the gun with Nola's fingerprints on it. Trying to investigate further, Kinsey realizes that 'Blackman' is code for an unidentified corpse in the morgue. She finds the gun concealed in the corpse. However, while she is at the hospital, she finds the recently murdered body of the morgue assistant and realizes the killer is at the hospital. It is Nola's current husband, Dr. Fraker, a pathologist from the hospital, who is also the blackmailer. Bobby found out what Fraker was up to; but Fraker rigged the first car accident before he could do anything about it, leading Bobby to eventually put Kinsey on the trail. Soon after, Fraker cut Bobby's brake lines, leading to his fatal crash, and falsified the autopsy results to point to a seizure. Fraker traps Kinsey and gives her a disabling injection, but she manages to cosh him and escapes to a phone to call the police. In the epilogue, she describes finally discharging the debt she feels she owes to Bobby and concludes with a wish that he is at peace. In a side plot, Kinsey's landlord and friend Henry begins a personal and business relationship with Lila Sams, newly arrived in Santa Teresa. Kinsey, rubbed the wrong way by Lila, discovers her to be a fraudster with multiple identities and turns her over to the police just as Lila is preparing to decamp with Henry's money.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective hired by a man she meets in the gym.\n\nReviews\nPublishers Weekly reviewed the novel positively, calling it fast paced, with quirky and believable characters, and written with a light and sure touch. Kirkus Reviews also praised the book, saying it was the best of the series so far, and that its strongest element was Kinsey Millhone. The review took note of Grafton's \"warm and swift\" writing style, and said that the plot was intriguing though far-fetched.\n\nAwards\n\"C\" Is for Corpse was awarded the 1987 Anthony Award for Best Novel at Bouchercon, the World Mystery Convention, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

It occurs in the Cordillera Oriental in the Tolima, Caquetá, and Putumayo Departments in Colombia and adjacent Napo in Ecuador. The generic placement of this species within the subfamily Centroleninae is uncertain (incertae sedis). The specific name medemi honors Fred Medem, collector of the holotype. Common name Medem giant glass frog has been coined for it.\n\nDescription\nAdult males measure 26–31 mm (1.0–1.2 in) and adult females 35–44 mm (1.4–1.7 in) in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded in dorsal profile and truncated to slightly protruding when viewed laterally. The tympanum is indistinct and partly covered by the supra-tympanic fold. The fingers have absent to extensive webbing (from inner to outer fingers). The toes are extensively webbed. The dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs are olive green to grayish brown and bear large cream spots. The ventral parietal peritoneum is white. Adult males have a large humeral spine. The pre-pollical spine is not separated from the first finger. The iris is grayish brown and has dark reticulation.\n\nHabitat and conservation\nThis species lives on streamsides in montane cloud forests at elevations of 790–1,800 m (2,590–5,910 ft) above sea level. It also occurs in secondary forest, as long as there is good vegetation cover close to streams. The eggs are laid on leaves overhanging the water. It is locally common in Colombia, but only one specimen, collected in 1975, is known from Ecuador. The specific threats are poorly known but probably include habitat loss, introduction alien predatory fishes, and pollution from the spraying of illegal crops. Chytridiomycosis might also be a threat.\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Civilized%22_Sexual_Morality_and_Modern_Nervous_Illness?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Civilized\" Sexual Morality and Modern Nervous Illness (German: Die „kulturelle“ Sexualmoral und die moderne Nervosität) is an article published by Sigmund Freud in 1908, in the journal Sexual-Probleme (\"Sexual Problems\"). Referencing Christian von Ehrenfels' distinction between cultural and natural sexual morality, Freud explains the etiological significance of cultural sexual morality as a reason for neurosis. At the beginning, Freud states that cultural sexual mores impose constraints on the individual, which can cause damage to the person, which in turn threatens the culture as a whole. While von Ehrenfels argues primarily on the basis of Social Darwinism, saying social sexual morality may prevent male sexual selection in reproduction, Freud focuses on the consequences of socially-imposed repression of the sexual instinct as a cause of neurosis. Culture is based on renunciation of drives. There is therefore a tension between a person's body, which seeks fulfilment of drives, and the demands of culture to renounce desire. Those who cannot conform to these requirements imposed by society are either viewed as criminals and perverts - if they cannot fulfil society's demand for renunciation - or escape into neurosis when the drives are suppressed to such an extent that neurotic substitute pleasures are developed in their stead. Neurosis is thus the negative counterpart of perversion, \"because they [neurotics] have the same appetites as the positive perverts in a 'repressed' state.\" Freud said that the \"perverse\" part of the libido is caused by a disturbance in development. The libido was originally meant for deriving pleasure, not only at the genitals but also at other erogenous zones; but education has the purpose of limiting autoeroticism and directing love towards objects other than oneself, finally achieving the \"primacy of genitals put into the service of procreation\". Thus Freud was one of the first people who said that sexuality by itself does not generate any internal conflict, and explained that the conflict arises only through interaction with the outside world, with its social norms and its expectation of repression of instincts, which leads to disease (repression thesis). The suppressed perverse drives are ideally channeled through sublimation and harnessed for cultural work. The sex drive in humans is aperiodic and is divorced from reproduction. Therefore, it can be metonymically shifted and applied to other areas. Thus, culture benefits to a great extent - and is even dependent - on sexual energy that is redirected through sublimation. Therefore, Freud concluded that a complete renunciation of the sex drive is detrimental to culture. Abstinence only produces \"brave weaklings\", but not great thinkers with bold ideas. Freud thus describes the dilemma of culture, which simultaneously calls for renunciation while still needing the sexual instinct to preserve itself. The repression model that imposes cultural sexual morality should therefore be abandoned in favor of a sublimation, displacement, and distribution model of sexual energies.\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Freud, Sigmund (1908). \"Die \"kulturelle\" Sexualmoral und die moderne Nervosität\" [\"Civilized\" Sexual Morality and Modern Nervous Illness].

He is credited with penning more than 500 tunes over the course of his long career.\n\nBiography\nJohn Mathis was born on September 28, 1930, in Maud, Texas. He played on Louisiana Hayride from 1951–60, as a solo artist and as a member of the musical duo Jimmy & Johnny (with Jimmy Lee Fautheree). Mathis left the group to go solo in the middle of the 1950s, leaving Fautheree's brother, Lynn, to fill his shoes. Jimmy and Lynn, however, saved the name Jimmy & Johnny, which proved ideal for Mathis who returned to the group from 1959 to 1961. As a solo artist, he released several singles for D Records, Decca, United Artists, and Little Darlin'. His final charting single was \"Please Talk to My Heart\", released in 1963. He also encountered significant success as a songwriter, penning songs for Johnny Paycheck, George Jones, and Webb Pierce among others. For few decades, until the late 1990s, he sang gospel music and focused on his family. Mathis suffered a stroke in February 1999, and was no longer able to perform. The stroke left him in poor health until his death in Cornersville, Tennessee on September 27, 2011, on the eve of his 81st birthday. He is survived by Jeannie Mathis, his wife of 43 years, and four children.\n\nSingles\n\n* \"I’ve Been Known To Cry\" \n* \"Welcome Home\" \n* \"Country Music Keeps on Growing\" \n* \"Make Me One More Memory\" \n* \"Harbor Of Love\" \n* \"Please Talk to My Heart\" (1963), U.S. Country #14\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n* Johnny \"Country\" Mathis profile, Allmusic.com; accessed September 26, 2016 \n* \"Country\" Johnny Mathis at Find a Grave" .

A partial skull was found by British paleontologist Charles William Andrews in the Fayum Depression. Andrews named Crocodylus megarhinus in 1905 on the basis of the holotype skull. A complete skull was also uncovered from Egypt in 1907 but was not recognized as \"C.\" megarhinus until 1927. \"C.\" megarhinus shares many features with living crocodiles like the Nile crocodile (C. niloticus), including a robust triangular skull that is shorter than most other crocodiles. Similarities are also seen in the teeth of the two species. Like living crocodiles, \"C.\" megarhinus has several constricted areas along the upper jaw that provide spaces for the teeth of the lower jaw when the mouth is closed. The proportions of \"C.\" megarhinus and C. niloticus are so similar that American paleontologist Charles C. Mook considered it \"very probable that C. megarhinus is a direct ancestor of C. niloticus.\" A second Fayum crocodilian, \"Crocodylus\" articeps, was named alongside \"C.\" megarhinus. Andrews distinguished \"C.\" articeps from \"C.\" megarhinus on the basis of its narrower snout, which is more similar to the slender-snouted crocodile than the Nile crocodile. \"C.\" articeps has recently been synonymized with \"C.\" megarhinus, and may represent a less mature form in the species' population. Although it has traditionally been described as a species of Crocodylus, \"C.\" megarhinus has been placed outside the genus in many recent phylogenetic analyses. A new genus has not yet been erected for the species. \"C.\" megarhinus is usually found to be a basal crocodyline outside the genus but still more closely related to it than the false gharial or mekosuchines. Below is a cladogram modified from Puértolas et al. (2011) showing its phylogenetic placement among crocodiles: A 2017 paper by Wu et al. (2017) recovers \"Crocodylus\" megarhinus as a relative of mekosuchines.\n\nReferences\n" .

The novel follows the development of Kinsey's relationship with Jonah Robb, the police officer she met in B is for Burglar.\n\nPlot summary\nKinsey Millhone receives a contract from ex-con Alvin Limardo to deliver a cashier's check for twenty-five thousand dollars to a fifteen-year-old boy named Tony Gahan. According to Limardo, Tony helped him through a tough time in his life, leaving Limardo indebted. However, when the retainer check Limardo made out to Kinsey for four hundred dollars bounces, she learns that Alvin Limardo is actually John Daggett, a man known by all and liked by few, and recently released from a local prison. He is also a bigamist. His first wife Essie's fanatical religious views have kept her married to Daggett, while Daggett, in disregard of his marital status, underwent a second marriage to Lovella on his release from prison, whom he has subjected to domestic abuse. In her search to find Daggett and get her money back, Kinsey discovers that he was found dead on the beach only a few days after hiring her. Through Daggett's daughter Barbara, Kinsey learns that Tony Gahan was the sole survivor of a family killed in a car accident caused by Daggett, for which he received a conviction on charges of vehicular manslaughter. Tony's been a wreck since the death of his family, rarely sleeping and doing poorly in school. He now lives with his uncle and aunt, Ramona and Ferrin Westfall. Also killed in the accident was a friend of Tony's young sister, and a boy called Doug Polokowski, who had hitched a ride in the car. Kinsey tracks down an ex-con friend of Daggett's, Billy Polo, now living in a trailer park with his sister, Coral. Billy introduced Lovella to Daggett. Kinsey finds out that Doug Polokowski was Billy and Coral's brother. There's no shortage of people with a motive for Daggett's death, but the police are classifying it as an accident. Kinsey discovers that shortly before his death, Daggett was staggering about drunk at the marina in the company of a blonde woman in a green outfit. Kinsey sets out to discover which of the numerous blonde women in the case might be the killer. She also suspects that Billy Polo is not giving her the full truth about his involvement with Daggett, a suspicion confirmed when Coral finally levels with Kinsey and reveals him to be blackmailing someone he suspects of Daggett's killing. The blackmailer murders Polo at the beach, using Kinsey's own gun, stolen from her car a few days earlier. Coral also admits to scheming with Billy and Lovella to rob Daggett of money he had come by illicitly in prison, not knowing that Daggett had given the money to Kinsey to pass on to Tony. The police investigating Billy's murder discover a home-made silencer used in the killing. Kinsey immediately recognizes the toweling used for padding as coming from the Westfall household, and Ramona jumps to the top of her suspect list. This means confronting Tony, who has given Ramona an alibi for the time of Daggett's death. In pursuing Tony, Kinsey realises Tony himself, dressed as a woman in his aunt's wig, was actually the killer. He was also the one who stole her gun and killed Billy Polo, who had recognized Tony at Daggett's funeral. Killing the man who killed his family has done nothing to ease Tony's torment, however; and he commits suicide by throwing himself off a building in front of Kinsey, despite her best effort to talk him down.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective who is hired by a man who gives her a retainer check, which then bounces.\n\nReviews\nThe novel received a positive review from Kirkus Reviews, which praised its plot, pace, poignancy, and realism. Publishers Weekly gave a more mixed review, saying that it was an enjoyable read but finding flaws in its plot.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

It measures 61 by 91 cm. The chair was described by auctioneers Christie's as being: \"In the form of unfurling petals, upholstered in brown leather, the frame in sculpted wood, lacquered brownish orange and silver and modelled as the serpentine, intertwined bodies of two dragons, their eyes in black lacquer on a white ground, their bodies decorated in low relief with stylised clouds.\" Christie's additionally felt that the chair \"...distills all that was so personal and so magical in the first, intimately expressive phase of Miss Gray's career — surprising, imaginative, subtly sculpted and crafted, it is a masterpiece of invention and execution.\" , the curator of the National Museum of Ireland's permanent exhibition of Gray's work, felt that the chair was the \"perfect example of the designer who created it – completely unique [and] rather eccentric\". The dragon imagery and clouds depicted on the chair have been likened to those found in the iconography of traditional Chinese art, and the flowing nature of the ornately carved armrests have been compared to a \"sea monster\" and given the chair its \"Dragons\" moniker. Gray worked on the chair between 1917 and 1919, lacquering the piece by hand and letting the lacquer set in her humid bathroom before spending days polishing the piece.\n\nHistory\nThe chair's first owner was Gray's patron, . It was acquired by Parisian art dealer Cheska Vallois in 1971 for $2,700 and then sold by Vallois to the French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent in 1973. The chair was put up for sale as part of the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé collection in February 2009 at Christie's auction house in Paris. It sold for €21,905,000 against a pre-sale estimate of €2-3 million, establishing a new record for a piece of 20th century decorative art. The price beat the previous record by $22 million. The 2009 buyer of the chair was once again Cheska Vallois who later said that the cost of acquiring it was \"the price of desire\". The chair was bought by Vallois for an unknown third party erroneously reported to be Henry and Marie-Josée Kravis in March 2009.\n\nReferences\n" .

Gilmore (1920) placed Dryosaurus grandis in the genus Ornithomimus, which rendered Lull's name secondarily preoccupied by Ornithomimus grandis Marsh, 1890 and necessitated the replacement name Ornithomimus affinis. However, the holotype specimen of Ornithomimus grandis comes from the Eagle Sandstone of Montana and is presumed lost, rendering Gilmore's action unnecessary. Matthew and Brown (1922) assigned the species to Coelosaurus, as C. affinis. In his 1972 review of North American ornithomimosaurs, Russell (1972) noticed that \"Dryosaurus\" grandis was similar to the Asian Archaeornithomimus in having curved pedal unguals, so referred to it as Archaeornithomimus affinis. Smith and Galton (1990), however, claimed that the Arundel taxon could not be assigned beyond the level of Theropoda. A 2016 paper by Chase Brownstein, however, confirmed Gilmore's assignment of \"Dryosaurus\" grandis to Ornithomimosauria, noting that the Arundel material is similar to Kinnareemimus and Nedcolbertia in the characteristics of the feet.\n\nReferences\n" .

The novel's plot develops Kinsey's personal back-story, as it features her second ex-husband, jazz musician and drug-user, Daniel Wade, previously mentioned briefly in C is for Corpse.\n\nPlot summary\nJust after Christmas, Kinsey Millhone discovers that five thousand dollars has mysteriously been credited to her bank account. She flashes back a few days to when she was asked to investigate a fire claim at a factory in Colgate as part of her informal office space rental arrangement with California Fidelity Insurance. The business in question, Wood/Warren, is owned and operated by the Wood family, whom Kinsey has known on a personal level since high school. Company founder Linden Wood is dead. His son Lance now runs the company, and his four other children—Ebony, Olive, Ash and Bass—all have a stake. Ash is Kinsey's former schoolmate; and Bass was an acquaintance of her second ex-husband, Daniel Wade. Olive is married to Terry Kohler, Lance's second-in-command at the company. After a solitary Christmas, with Henry away visiting relatives and Rosie's Tavern shut down until the new year, Kinsey writes off the fire as an industrial accident. Upon submitting her report to her boss, she finds that significant papers have been removed from the file and others substituted, giving an appearance that Lance Wood has bribed Kinsey not to label the fire as arson. In the middle of protesting her innocence, the five thousand dollar credit takes on a sinister significance. Temporarily suspended from California Fidelity, Kinsey takes up her own investigation to prove her innocence, aided (unwillingly at first) by CFI administrator Darcy. Darcy is united with Kinsey in her dislike of claims manager Andy Motycka, who is Kinsey's chief suspect in the set-up. She is at a loss and cannot imagine for whom he could be working. Kinsey reconnects with the Wood family and learns some of their dark family secrets: that Ebony, the oldest sister, wants control of the business and that Lance was practically a criminal in high school. She also learns that a former Wood/Warren employee, Hugh Case, committed suicide two years before, although the suspicious disappearance of all the lab work on Hugh's body seems to support his widow Lyda's claim that it was murder rather than suicide. Kinsey remains unconvinced by Lyda's conviction that Lance was Hugh's killer but can't seem to find any other leads. Her spirits are at a low ebb, and it's the worst possible moment for Daniel to show up (eight years after leaving without a word). Kinsey finds it hard it cope with but eventually agrees to store a guitar for him while he sorts himself out. On her way to a new year party at Olive and Terry's home, Kinsey is almost killed when a bomb, disguised as a gift left on the doorstep, explodes. Olive is killed, and Terry is badly injured. Kinsey does her best to resist Daniel's attempts to nurse her, and her distrust is proven right when she finds out the guitar she has been storing for Daniel is bugged and that he has been reporting on her investigation to Ebony and Bass Wood. She discovers Daniel and Bass are lovers—Bass is the person for whom Daniel left her. Shortly afterwards, Kinsey finds Lyda Case's dead body in a car outside her apartment. Forcing answers from the Wood family, Kinsey learns an even darker family secret: that Lance had an incestuous affair with Olive when they were teenagers, leaving Olive emotionally and sexually scarred for the rest of her life. Kinsey's suspicions immediately jump to Terry Kohler; and when the police identify fingerprints on the car Lyda was found in as belonging to an escaped convicted bomber called Chris Emms, she realizes Terry and Emms are the same person. Unfortunately, Emms has anticipated her solving the case and is waiting at her apartment with another bomb. Before it explodes, he explains he killed Hugh Case because Hugh had realized his true identity; and he killed Lyda because she had belatedly found Hugh's records of that. He engineered the fire at Wood/Warren and set up Kinsey (with the aid of Andy Motycka) to get revenge on Lance after Bass spilled the family incest secret to him. Kinsey manages to shoot Emms and disables him sufficiently to get out of the bathroom window just as the bomb explodes, killing Emms and destroying her garage apartment. After Daniel leaves with Bass, the only loose end is the five thousand dollars Emms put in her account; and on the advice of Lieutenant Dolan, Kinsey keeps it.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective who investigates an insurance claim for a fire and finds herself framed for an arson fire.\n\nDevelopment of the story\nIn 2005, Grafton told an interviewer that she prefers to pick a title early in the writing process because that helps to direct her storytelling. \"For one book I had thought of \"E\" Is for Ever. I loved the play on words but I had to figure a better title. So I picked \"E\" Is for Evidence. If I know the title I can make sure the story I'm telling is pertinent.\"\n\nReviews\n\n* Kirkus Reviews called the book a \"first class entertainment,\" praising its pace, characters, and charm, but noted that the plot was crucially flawed. \n* Publishers Weekly wrote that the book was not up to the standards of its predecessors due to the motivations for crimes being weak; however, they felt that readers would still enjoy the series.\n\nAwards\nThe novel was nominated for the 1989 Anthony Award for Best Novel.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

Founded in 1993 by former members of the fascist Iron Guard, the party claimed to adhere to a \"national-Christian\" doctrine and styled itself as the successor to the interwar party of the same name. It was banned in 2015. ECP appeared as a feedback to the continuity and consolidation of the system structures before 1989, the development of the corrupt and immoral politicians, and the founders believing that the last have threatened the existence of the Romanian nation and the Romanian unitary national state, threatening the Romania with the isolation from the civilized world. Under these circumstances, the old fighters considered that the National Resistance should continue, but under the conditions and frameworks provided by the Rule of Law. PTT worships the legionnaires Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, Horia Sima or Radu Gyr, as it appears from the publication \"Buciumul\".\n\nDoctrine\nECP relies on the national-Christian doctrine values, standing at the right of the Romanian political scene. The basic principles and values of the ECP are discipline, moral order, national and Christian values, and Rule of Law. From the ideological point of view, PPPs is against racism, chauvinism, totalitarianism and extremism of any kind. The founders of ECP have repeatedly stated that this party is the only political force that legitimately pursues the spirit of the National Anticommunist Resistance. Unlike the cuzist's ideology and same of the Legionary one, ECP has not formally adopted anti-Semitism as a social goal or practice.\n\nHeadquarter\nIn the media around 2000, the PTT became the only party in Romania whose members built, exclusively by their own money and work, the central headquarter on a land donated by a member, who was the former political prisoner (Freedom, September 1999).\n\nLeadership\n\n* President: Virgil Totoescu (Suceava) - teacher, participant at the National Anticommunist Resistance, former political prisoner from 1948 to 1964.

Royce Fowler wants the detective to exonerate his son of the murder of Jean Timberlake, seventeen years before, in Floral Beach, California. Bailey Fowler pleaded guilty to killing Jean, his sometime girlfriend, and escaped from prison soon afterwards. He has apparently been living the life of a model citizen under an assumed name. He is recaptured and is claiming his innocence. Kinsey heads to Floral Beach, a tiny local community, to pursue the cold trail; and she stays with the Fowler family at their motel. Royce is dying of cancer; his wife Oribelle is sick with diabetes; and their daughter Ann, Bailey's senior by five years, has taken leave of absence from her job as a counselor at the local high school to provide care for her parents. Bailey's lawyer, Jack Clemson, fills her in on the details of the case: Jean, 17 when she died, was a problem child who was doing badly in school and engaged in numerous sexual encounters with the local boys at school—and some of the local men, as well. She was pregnant at the time of her death. Everyone knows everyone in Floral Beach, and Kinsey acquaints herself with a number of the locals in pursuit of the truth: Pearl, the local bar-owner, whose son's evidence put Bailey on the spot at the time of Jean's death; Tap Granger, who was Bailey's accomplice in several robberies before the murder; the local pastor, Reverend Haws, and his wife; and Dr. Dunne, whose wife Elva has a violent objection to being questioned. The high school principal at the time of the murder, Dwight Shales, offers some help. Attention is turned to Jean's single mother, Shana, whose friendship with Dwight is causing raised eyebrows around Floral Beach. She is struggling with longstanding alcohol problems, is less co-operative, and refuses to identify Jean's father. Nobody seems convinced that the killer could be anyone but Bailey. At Bailey's arraignment, Tap Granger stages a hold-up, allowing Bailey to escape once more. Tap is himself killed in the escape. Kinsey gets confirmation from Tap's widow that Tap was paid to do it—for the first time providing concrete evidence that someone wants to keep Bailey discredited. Someone breaks into Kinsey's motel room at the motel, and she receives threatening calls in the middle of the night as she pursues the case. Oribelle is murdered following the adulteration of her insulin, medication that is administered regularly by Ann. Kinsey establishes that Dr. Dunne is Jean's unknown father. Shana is murdered when she sets out to keep a rendezvous with him. Kinsey runs from the cops herself after she finds the body and seeks refuge with Dwight Shales, who confesses that he, too, was having an affair with Jean and was probably the father of her child. Kinsey realizes that Ann Fowler is jealous of anyone who comes into contact with Dwight. She searches Ann's room and finds evidence that Ann supplied Tap with the hold-up gun and made the anonymous phone calls. Unfortunately, she also finds Ann waiting for her, armed with a shotgun. Jean had confided in her, as school counselor, that Dwight was the father of her child. Motivated by jealousy, Ann killed her; and being equally jealous of her brother's position as favored child of their parents, Ann was happy to see him take the rap. Her plan is to use the money she will eventually inherit from her parents to tempt Dwight into marriage. She killed her mother to hasten the plan along. She also killed Shana, Jean's mother, because she was jealous of her friendship with Dwight. Before Ann can kill Kinsey, she is interrupted by Royce, who wrestles the gun away from Ann, shooting her in the foot accidentally in the process. Ann, injured, is arrested for the murders of Shana and Oribelle. Though there is insufficient evidence to prove her to be Jean's killer, the circumstances are sufficient to ensure that Bailey is cleared of the murder.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective called to Floral Beach to solve a case for an innocent man who has escaped from prison. \n* Jean Timberlake: Murdered teen girl, whose murderer claims innocence. \n* Royce Fowler: Father of the accused murderer, who hires Kinsey Millhone to find the murderer of Jean Timberlake.

Publishers Weekly gave a similar review, calling the plot \"complex\" and noting the main character's continued development. The review said that \"Grafton's series promises to hold readers all the way to Z.\"\n\nDevelopment of novel\nGrafton had originally planned to call the novel \"F\" Is for Forgery but decided during her research that \"forgery was too boring a crime\", shifting to a plot with fugitives from the law.\n\nPublication history\nThis is the first of her novels to appear on a best seller list, in paperback fiction.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22False_positives%22_scandal?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The \"false positives\" scandal (Escándalo de los falsos positivos in Spanish) was a series of murders in Colombia, part of the armed conflict in that country between the government and guerrilla forces of the FARC and the ELN. Members of the military had poor or mentally impaired civilians lured to remote parts of the country with offers of work, killed them, and presented them to authorities as guerrilleros killed in battle, in an effort to inflate body counts and receive promotions or other benefits. As of June 2012, a total of 3,350 such cases had been investigated in all parts of the country and verdicts had been reached in 170 cases. Human rights groups have charged that the judicial cases progressed too slowly. A 2018 study claims a total of 10,000 \"false positive\" victims between 2002 and 2010. The name of the scandal refers to the technical term of \"false positive\" which describes a test falsely detecting a condition that is not present.\n\n2008 Soacha case\nAs a precedent between August 7, 2002 and August 6, 2004, more than six thousand people were released from liberty, violating agreements and norms established within human rights. Many of the cases lacked due process. Thus, for this period there were arrests without substantiated evidence, mass arrests that ignored international law amid military operations and arrests used as a mechanism for political persecution. The scandal broke in 2008, when 22 men from Soacha who had been recruited for work were found dead several hundred miles away. A recruiter later testified that he had received $500 from the Colombian military for each man he recruited and delivered to them. In June 2012, six members of the army were sentenced to long prison sentences in that case. After the 2008 Soacha discoveries, defense minister Juan Manuel Santos denied knowledge of the scheme, fired 27 officers including three generals and changed the army's body count system. General Mario Montoya, commander of the Colombian Army, resigned on November 4, 2008. President Alvaro Uribe ordered the cases to be handled by civilian courts to ensure impartiality. According to reports in 2009, both Defense Minister Santos and President Uribe have claimed that there were cases of false denunciations where legitimate killings were presented as \"false positives\" in order to stain the name of the military and undermine military morale.\n\nEarlier cases\nAccusations of similar cases had occurred much earlier. A recently declassified 1990 cable by U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara reported on a case involving nine men who were killed by the military, dressed in military fatigues and presented as guerrilleros. Similar extrajudicial executions have been reported throughout the 1990s.\n\nUN investigation and report, 2009\nIn June 2009, UN special rapporteur Philip Alston carried out an investigation of extrajudicial executions in Colombia. He reported: The victim is lured under false pretenses by a \"recruiter\" to a remote location. There, the individual is killed soon after arrival by members of the military. The scene is then manipulated to make it appear as if the individual was legitimately killed in combat. The victim is commonly photographed wearing a guerrilla uniform, and holding a gun or grenade. Victims are often buried anonymously in communal graves, and the killers are rewarded for the results they have achieved in the fight against the guerillas. [...] I interviewed witnesses and survivors who described very similar killings in the departments of Antioquia, Arauca, Valle del Cauca, Casanare, Cesar, Cordoba, Huila, Meta, Norte de Santander, Putumayo, Santander, Sucre, and Vichada. A significant number of military units were thus involved. [...] Evidence showing victims dressed in camouflage outfits which are neatly pressed, or wearing clean jungle boots which are four sizes too big for them, or lefthanders holding guns in their right hand, or men with a single shot through the back of their necks, further undermines the suggestion that these were guerillas killed in combat. [...] I have found no evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out as a matter of official Government policy, or that they were directed by, or carried out with the knowledge of, the President or successive Defence Ministers. On the other hand, the explanation favoured by many in Government – that the killings were carried out on a small scale by a few bad apples – is equally unsustainable.\n\nTrials\nIn 2011, a colonel of the Colombian army received a sentence of 21 years in prison for his admitted involvement in the killing of two peasants who were then presented as guerrilleros. He also admitted that his unit had carried out 57 similar murders. He claimed that he learned of previous \"false positive\" killings when he first arrived at his unit, and was warned by Defence Minister Santos to obtain measurable results or lose his position. He later testified at other \"false positive\" trials. In 2013 a Colombian radio station played a tape on which the colonel is overheard extorting other army members with offers not to testify against them.\n\nRecent developments\nThe International Federation for Human Rights produced a report on the scandal in May 2012, alleging over 3,000 civilian victims between 2002 and 2008. The group asked the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court prosecutor to open an investigation, as \"those who bear the greatest responsibility for these crimes are not being investigated or prosecuted in Colombia.\" Former defense minister Santos was elected President of Colombia in 2010; in 2012 he backed legislation that has been criticized by human rights groups because they fear it could potentially revert the \"false positive\" cases to military courts. The text of a 2013 law which regulated and implemented the previous 2012 reform includes extrajudicial executions among a list of crimes which will continue to remain under civilian court jurisdiction and will not be submitted to military courts. Critics have expressed concern that the defense lawyers of military personnel accused in false positive cases may argue that their crimes are not extrajudicial executions (which were previously not defined as a crime in the Colombian penal code) but homicides, as a way to avoid the jurisdiction of civilian courts and request a transfer to military courts. Legislators who supported the bill have argued that another paragraph in the law expressly states that cases of false positives currently in civilian justice cannot be transferred to the military justice system.According to the report of the working group on the arbitrary detention of the United Nations, arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been used in other countries as one of the most common practices to imprison political opponents, religious dissidents or to restrict the freedom of expression, it has been found that these imprisonments are also based on the fight against terrorism.\n\nHuman Rights Watch report of 2015 and consequences\nIn June 2015, Human Rights Watch presented a report on the scandal. At that point, about 800 people, mostly ordinary soldiers, had been convicted in related cases. The report criticized that the majority of cases had been handled by military courts, in contradiction to a Supreme Court ruling. Military judges had suppressed evidence and manipulated crime scenes. Whistleblowers were punished. According to the report, both commander of the armed forces General Juan Pablo Rodríguez and top army chief General Jaime Lasprilla had formerly headed units that committed extrajudicial killings. In July 2016, President Santos rejected the report's claims that high military commanders had escaped punishment for extrajudicial killings. At the same time, he dismissed General Jaime Alfonso Lasprilla, marine commander Admiral Hernando Wills, and air force commander General Guillermo León.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Philip Alston final report, 31 March 2010 \n* Colombia.

Another cloth of the same pattern was found later and has the words \"put down South Qiang\" (討南羌). In 2002, they were designated one of the cultural relics that forbidden to be exhibited abroad.\n\nDiscovery\nThe pieces were unearthed in October 1995 at the Niya ruins in Xinjiang. It was found near the elbow/waist area of a corpse in a rich tomb.\n\nInterpretation\nThe phrase \"Five stars rising east benefit China\" (五星出東方利中國) resembles a similar phrase found in the Records of the Grand Historian's scroll 27 (五星分天之中，積於東方，中國利). In the ancient times the five stars were represented as Chenxing (辰星), Taibai (太白), Yinghuo (熒惑), Suixing (歲星) and Zhenxing (鎮星). In modern times these are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn respectively. These are also represented by Wu xing with water, metal, earth, fire, wood. Researchers from the Japanese observatory said the next alignment of the five stars to the east will not be until March 21, 2022. The phrase \"put down South Qiang\" (討南羌) refers to the area that was first mentioned in a sentence in the Western Han Essentials's (西漢會要) scroll 46 in relation to the four ancient commandery. The four are geographically today's Gansu Dunhuang, Jiuquan, Zhangye and Wuwei. When the two pieces are combined, it forms the phrase \"Five stars rising east benefit China put down South Qiang\" (五星出東方利中國討南羌), though the meaning is up for debate.\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Free_Albania%22_National_Committee?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Free Albania\" National Committee (Albanian: Komiteti Kombëtar \"Shqipëria e Lirë\"), also known as \"Free Albania\" National-Democratic Committee, also National Committee for a Free Albania or NCFA, was a political organization of post-World War II Albanian emigre in the Western countries. It was supported by CIA, placed as member of National Committee for a Free Europe. The committee aimed organizing the Albanian diaspora and cooperating with western powers into overthrown Enver Hoxha's Communist regime in Albania.The committee creation started in Rome and was finalized in Paris in the summer of 1949.\n\nBackground\nWith the triumph of Communism in Albania, many of the political factors of Albania during World War II had to flee the country. Many of them collaborated with the western government and secret services into overthrowing the communists, and changing the form of the regime in Albania. The base for the committee was heterogeneous, the most known actors were former Balli Kombëtar members including Mithat Frashëri, Abas Ermenji, Vasil Andoni, Hafëz Jusuf Azemi, Ali Klissura, etc., Legaliteti members with its leader Abaz Kupi, \"Bloku Kombetar Indipendent\" (Independent National Bloc) of pro-Italian and/or collaborationist elements that were involved with Albanian puppet governments during the war, i.e. Ernest Koliqi, Mustafa Kruja, Gjon Marka Gjoni, Shefqet Verlaci, anti-fascist and anti-communist guerrillas who cooperated with British-American emissaries during the war led by Said bey Kryeziu, other independent anti-communists, i.e. Muharrem Bajraktari, as well as other political fractions like \"Peasant League\" (Albanian: Lidhja Katundare), etc.\n\nCreation\nThe preparation started in Rome in 1948, with the initiative of Legaliteti. After the rejection of Balli Kombëtar (due to political antagonism inherited since World War II), Balli's leader Mithat Frashëri resumed the initiative again. This time strong confrontations happened between Balli members and \"Bloku Kombetar Indipendent\" which definitely stayed out of the committee. State Department did not want any of the Blloku members involved in the committee due to their pro Italian/German stance during the war, but there was a silent voucher for guerillas like Ismail Vërlaci and Ndue Gjomarkaj (Markagjonj) who could join as individuals and not as representatives of Blloku. An inaugural storefront office was opened in Paris, 1 July 1949. Free Albania\" National Committee was officially constituted on July 7 (although some Albanian sources place it later in time, on 26 August 1949). Mithat Frashëri was its chairman, with other members of the Directing Board: Nuçi Kotta (son of the Albanian former Prime Minister Kostaq Kotta), Abaz Kupi, Said Kryeziu, and Zef Pali. There was also a national committee consisted of Eqrem Telhai of \"Peasant League\" (Albanian: Lidhja Katundare), Hysni Mulleti of \"Agrarian League\" (Albanian: Lidhja Agrare), Muharrem Bajraktari as \"Independent Fighting Group\" (Albanian: Grupi Luftëtar i Pavarur), Ihsan Toptani - independent, Gaqo Gogo, a pro-monarchist and former King Zog I's secretary, Myftar Spahiu and Gani Tafilaj from Legaliteti, whilst Halil Maçi, Vasil Andoni, and Abaz Ermenji from Balli Kombëtar.Gaqo Gogo served also as Executive Secretary, while Abaz Kupi was appointed chairman of the military junta, with Ermenji and Kryeziu as his deputies. On September 6, 1949, the committee proclaimed itself in a BBC radio transmission. In the following days, Mithat Frashëri would organize a press-conference, which rose another conflict with pro-Yugoslavian British authorities, opposing Frashëri's words which included \"Kosovo\", stating that he should speak only regarding territories subject to Albanian state. Soon-after, the British intelligence officer Billy McLean together with Alan Hare and Harold Perkins flew to Alexandria, Egypt where they joined Julian Amery and Robert Low. They had a meeting with King Zog trying to persuade him to recognize the committee. Former King of Albania, Ahmet Zogu, opposed the committee even though his supporter Abaz Kupi was one of the founders, with the explanation that he was the only legitimate representative of Albania. The committee published the biweekly journal \"Shqiperia\" (Albania) in Albanian language.\n\nPost 1949\nThe committee was restructured with its center in New York City. After Frashëri's death in October 1949, Hasan Dosti took over, but later Rexhep Krasniqi, a Kosovar Albanian became chairman with support of Xhafer Deva who had previously settled in US.Abas Ermenji continued to work in France, where he published the journal \"Qëndresa Shqiptare\" (Albanian: Albanian Resistance). The committee collaborated with CIA into forming the Company 4000 military units, stationed in Hohenbrunn, Bavaria, West Germany in 1950. The \"company\" consisted of trained military units, supporting the Albanian Subversion, though it was never effective. With Albania joining UN in 1955, the committee's activities diminished over the years, but it continued to organize political gatherings, conferences, and seminars. Over 15,000 Albanian refugees were resettled in the United States through its efforts. Krasniqi publisher the newspaper \"The Free Albanian\" (Albanian: Shqiptari i lirë) from November 1957 to 1970. It was one of the nine national representations which were used by State Department to create the Assembly of Captive European Nations (ACEN). With the demise of communism, the board of directors of the FAC decided that its functions would no longer be needed, and it was disbanded in 1992.\n\nCIA involvement\nRecent(2013) CIA documents becoming public, which found a vast reflection in the Albanian media, showed CIA's deep involvement in committee's creation and activity, as well as the sponsor.\n\nSee also\n\n* Albanian Subversion\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Histoire de l'Albanie et de sa Maison Royale (5 volumes); Patrice Najbor - JePublie - Paris - 2008 \n* Document release by CIA" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "Ricky Donnell \"Freeway Rick\" Ross (born January 26, 1960) is an American author and former drug trafficker best known for the drug empire he established in Los Angeles, California, in the early to mid 1980s. He was sentenced to life in prison, though the sentence was shortened on appeal and Ross was released in 2009.\n\nBiography\nRoss attended school at Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles. He played for the tennis team but was unable to get a college scholarship because he was illiterate. Ross has said that when he first saw crack cocaine as a teenager in 1979, he did not immediately believe it was a drug because it looked different from other drugs he had seen. The nickname Freeway came from Ross owning properties along the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway and living next to Interstate 110. According to an October 2013 Esquire magazine article, \"Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine,\" with Ross's gross revenue claimed to be more than $900 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion in 2019) and profits of almost $300 million ($900 million in 2019). During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have sold \"$3 million in one day.\" According to the East Bay Times, \"In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $500 million between 1983 and 1984.\" In 1996, Ross was sentenced to life imprisonment under the three-strikes law after being convicted for purchasing more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent in a sting operation. Later that year, a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News revealed a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources, Danilo Blandón, and the CIA as part of the Iran–Contra affair. Having learned to read at the age of 28, during his first stint in prison, Ross spent much of his time behind bars studying the law. He eventually discovered a legal loophole that would lead to his release. Ross's case was brought to a federal court of appeals which found that the three-strikes law had been erroneously applied and reduced his sentence to 20 years. He was released from Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana on September 29, 2009. Ross was arrested in October 2015 on suspicion of possessing cash related to the sales of illegal drugs when police discovered $100,000 in his possession during a traffic stop. Ross later alleged that he had been racially profiled and stated that he was carrying a large amount of cash for the purchase of a home. Charges were ultimately dropped, and Ross explained he had earned the cash from book sales and speaking fees.\n\nCocaine use and business\n\n\nCocaine introduction\nRoss began selling cocaine after his illiteracy prevented him from earning a tennis scholarship for college. He began spending time with an upholstery teacher at a Los Angeles community college who revealed he dealt cocaine and offered Ross a small amount to sell. Ross used his profit to purchase more cocaine to sell, expanding his small operation. Ross eventually began to ask for quantities to sell that exceeded what the teacher was willing to procure, so he turned to find a new dealer. The teacher referred Ross to his supplier, Ivan Arguellas, who offered to keep Ross supplied. Arguellas was able to provide larger quantities at a better price, and Ross quickly went from dealing in grams of cocaine to dealing in ounces. About eight months after becoming Ross's supplier, Arguellas was shot in the spine, resulting in months of hospitalization that forced him out of the cocaine business. His brother-in-law Henry Corrales took over the business, but was not enthusiastic about the trade and had failed to make any connections of his own to suppliers. A Nicaraguan exile and cocaine distributor named Danilo Blandón was acquainted with Arguellas and Corrales, and although he did not know him personally, was impressed with the amount of cocaine that Ross was moving. Blandón offered to supply cocaine to Corrales to sell to Ross, for a fifty-fifty split of the profit. Eventually, Corrales lost his appetite for the cocaine business and retired, at which point Ross became a direct customer of Blandón. Through his connection to Blandón, and Blandón's supplier Norwin Meneses Cantarero, Ross was able to purchase Nicaraguan cocaine at significantly reduced rates. Ross began distributing cocaine at $10,000 per kilo less than the average street price, distributing it to the Bloods and Crips street gangs. By 1982, Ross had received his moniker of \"Freeway Ricky\" and claimed to have sold up to US$3 million worth of cocaine per day, purchasing 455 kg of cocaine a week. Ross initially invested most of his profits in houses and businesses, because he feared his mother would catch on to what he was doing if he started spending lavishly on himself. In a jailhouse interview with reporter Gary Webb, Ross said, \"We were hiding our money from our mothers.\" He invested a portion of the proceeds from his drug dealing activities in Anita Baker's first album.\n\nDrug empire\nWith thousands of employees, Ross has said he operated drug sales not only in Los Angeles but in places across the country including St. Louis, New Orleans, Texas, Kansas City, Oklahoma, Indiana, Cincinnati, North Carolina, South Carolina, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Seattle. He has said that his most lucrative sales came from the Ohio area. He made similar claims in a 1996 PBS interview. According to the East Bay Times, \"In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $600 million in the process.\" Adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, this becomes more than a billion dollars in 2013. Much of Ross's success at evading law enforcement was due to his ring's possession of police scanners and voice scramblers. Following one drug bust, a Los Angeles County sheriff remarked that Ross's men had \"better equipment than we have.\" According to the October 2013 Esquire article, \"Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine. In 1980 dollars, his gross earnings were said to be in excess of $900 million – with a profit of nearly $300 million. Converted roughly to present-day dollars: $2.5 billion gross and $850 million in profit. As his distribution empire grew to include forty-two cities, the price he paid per kg of powder cocaine dropped from as much as $60,000 to as low as $10,000.\"\n\nLawsuit against rapper Rick Ross\nOn June 18, 2010, Ross sued rapper Rick Ross (real name William Leonard Roberts II) for using his name, filing a copyright infringement lawsuit against Ross in a California Federal Court. Jay-Z had been called to testify in the lawsuit, as he was President of Def Jam when Ross was signed to the label. Ross sought $10 million in compensation in the lawsuit. After the lawsuit was dismissed on July 3, 2010, the album Teflon Don was released as scheduled on July 20, 2010. A federal judge ruled that the case should be refiled in California state court because it fell under California state law. Ross refiled the case with the State of California and the federal case is on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The state case was filed in 2011 in California. Ross refiled in Los Angeles Superior Court with publicity rights claims. Trial was set for early May 2012. The case was dismissed by a judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The California State case was updated with a motion in Freeway Rick Ross's favor as to Warner Bros. Records and their use of the name and image Rick Ross in July 2012. The New York Post reported that a trial was set for August 27, 2013 in Freeway Rick Ross versus Rick Ross and Warner Music Group. On December 30, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the rapper Rick Ross, allowing him to keep the name based on a First Amendment ruling.\n\nBook\nIn 2013, The Huffington Post reported that journalist and author Cathy Scott was co-writing Ross's autobiography with him, scheduled for release in 2014. The memoir, Freeway Rick Ross: The Untold Autobiography, was released at a book launch with author Scott at the Eso Won Bookstore in Los Angeles on June 17, 2014 to a standing-room only crowd. KCET TV in its review wrote, \"(The book) is fascinating for its unsentimental, inside look at his career on the streets of South Central, which started for Ross with car theft and quickly shifted to drugs and the big time.\"\n\nAward\nThe memoir was nominated for ForeWord Review's IndiFab Best Book of the Year Award 2014 in the true crime category. In June 2015, winners were announced, with the book named as a Foreword Reviews' 2014 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award Finalist, True Crime. Ross was a key figure in filmmaker Kevin Booth's documentary American Drug War: The Last White Hope. The second episode of the first season of BET's American Gangster documentary series was focused on the story of Ricky Ross and his connection to the Iran–Contra scandal. Ross was a guest interview on VH1's Planet Rock History of Crack and Hip Hop Documentary. Ross is featured in the 2015 two-part documentary Freeway: Crack in the System, which details various levels of the drug trade, the Iran–Contra scandal, and mass incarceration. In 2016, the documentary was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism: Long Form. Since 2013, Ross has been a regular guest on The Joe Rogan Experience. In the 2014 film Kill the Messenger, Ross is portrayed by Michael K. Williams.\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n* Webb, Gary (1999). Dark Alliance. Seven Stories Press.

In \"G\" Is for Gumshoe, Kinsey Millhone meets fellow investigator Robert Dietz when someone hires a hit man to kill her. While Kinsey is being stalked, she uncovers an unsolved murder that haunts the lives of her client Mrs. Irene Gersh and Irene's \"mother\" who uses the alias \"Agnes Grey\" (the title of an Anne Brontë novel). In other developments in Kinsey's personal story, she loses her VW car, and her friend Vera Lipton becomes engaged.\n\nPlot summary\nThree things happen to Kinsey Millhone on her thirty-third birthday: she moves into her remodeled apartment, which has finally been finished; she is hired by Irene Gersh, a sickly Santa Teresa resident, to head out to the Slabs in the Mojave Desert and locate her mother; and she gets the news that Tyrone Patty, a particularly dangerous criminal she helped the Carson City Police Department track down a few years back, has hired a hit-man to kill her. After her first night in her new place, Kinsey heads out early the next day in search of Mrs Gersh's mother, Agnes Grey, who lives in a trailer in the desert. Agnes isn't home, and the trailer seems to be occupied by two teenage runaways; but Kinsey eventually tracks Agnes down at a local convalescent hospital, where she has been since being taken suddenly ill on a trip to a local town sometime before. Agnes, 83 years old, has not been a model patient; and the hospital staff are delighted to hear that she has relatives who can take responsibility for her. Irene makes plans to transfer Agnes to a facility in Santa Teresa. But Agnes seems terrified of going there and tells Kinsey a confused story about a number of people from the past, including Lottie and Emily, who died. Kinsey makes plans to come home, but before she can do so, a man in a pick-up truck deliberately runs her off the road, seriously injuring Kinsey and totaling her treasured VW automobile. Kinsey recognizes the driver as a man traveling with his young son she has seen a couple of times on the journey to the Slabs, and realizes she needs to take the death threat against her seriously. She hires Robert Dietz, the PI who helped her briefly on an earlier case, as a bodyguard. His vigilance initially frustrates Kinsey, who is used to making her own decisions; but they soon begin an affair. Dietz discovers the hitman is Mark Messinger, who absconded with his son, Eric, eight months previously. He arranges a meeting with the child's mother, Rochelle, who is desperate to get her son back, and offers to help her. Meanwhile, Agnes goes missing only a few hours after getting to Santa Teresa. She is soon found, yet she dies of fright within a day. Kinsey and Robert Dietz suspect she was kept prisoner somewhere before her death. Irene suffers a serious panic reaction when she sees a tea set Kinsey found among her mother's possessions, and Kinsey suspects this has triggered a buried childhood memory. Further anomalies occur when Irene tries to fill in the paperwork relating to the death: Kinsey realizes that Irene's birth certificate is faked and that Agnes Grey is a pseudonym. It's Kinsey's CFI colleague Darcy who points out Agnes Grey is the name of a novel by Anne Brontë, which seems to link to the names Emily and Lottie (Charlotte) Agnes had mentioned. Kinsey tracks down a family called Bronfen, who match the circumstances Agnes described, and surmises that the surviving brother of the family, Patrick, murdered Lottie and Emily. She is convinced that when Patrick killed Irene's mother, Sheila, Agnes Grey was Anne Bronfen, a third sister, who took off with Irene to protect her, changing their identities and posing as the young Irene's mother. The three daughters were presumably named for the Brontë sisters, which explains the alias Anne chose to use. Patrick faked Anne's death in order to gain sole possession of the family property. Kinsey is convinced that Patrick is responsible for Agnes's death, to cover his past crimes, and discovers evidence of further killings at his home. When she confronts Patrick, she is interrupted by Messinger, who kills Patrick. Dietz and Rochelle have managed to get Eric away from Messinger, and Messinger's stated intention is to use Kinsey as a hostage to exchange for Eric. As she drives Messinger to the airport at gunpoint to intercept Rochelle, Kinsey is convinced Messinger will kill them all; and he succeeds in killing Rochelle's twin Roy, who was attempting to help her escape with Eric. However, Rochelle outsmarts Messinger and kills him first. In the epilogue, the third contract killer hired by Tyrone Patty is apprehended; and Patty himself dies as a consequence of a jail altercation. Dietz leaves to pursue his plan of providing anti-terrorism training on military bases.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator hired to find the 83-year-old mother of her client.\n\nReception\n\"G\" Is for Gumshoe was honored with both the Private Eye Writers of America's Shamus Award for best novel and Bouchercon's 1991 Anthony Award for Best Novel.

Known as \"Galway Joe\" to distinguish him from Joe Dolan of Mullingar, he was born in Galway, County Galway, Ireland. Dolan was an arts student in Dublin before becoming involved in the Irish showbands of the 1960s, playing guitar with The Capitol Showband and The Swingtime Aces. He is best known as one of the three founding members, together with Andy Irvine and Johnny Moynihan, of the highly influential folk group Sweeney's Men, which was formed in Galway in May 1966; Dolan also chose the group's name. Sweeney's Men invigorated the Irish folk scene, and had an unexpected Irish top 10 hit with \"Old Maid in the Garret\" in 1967. The week \"Old Maid in the Garret\" was in the Top Ten, Dolan left the band to go to Israel with the intention of taking part in the Six-Day War. Later on, Des Kelly—Sweeney's Men's manager—joked that Dolan had arrived on the seventh day, \"but it took him a year to get down there\". He wrote the song \"The Trip to Jerusalem\" about his journey there, which was later recorded by Christy Moore in 1978 on the album The Iron Behind the Velvet. In that album's sleeve notes, Moore quoted Dolan's explanation of the genesis of the song: I wrote this song in my salad days (back in 1965) [sic] when I worked on an archeological expedition to Masada in the Negev desert. I was on general duty on top of the mountain with a walkie-talkie and a weapon and the temperature was about 120 degrees in the shade. I was thinking of how I'd got there. —Sleeve notes from The Iron Behind the Velvet. His song \"The Foxy Devil\" was also recorded by Moore on the same album. The Dubliners covered \"Nelson's Farewell\", which was a hit in Ireland, and the trio Ardvarna released a beautiful version of \"Mayfly Days\". Dolan subsequently dropped professional music in favour of painting, but continued to compose and would pass on tapes to anyone who was interested. He continued to play in local sessions.\n\nDeath\nDolan died of cancer in January 2008, survived by his son Andy, sister Chris, brother-in-law Vim, and nieces Eileen and Jessica. His autobiography, Lost Miles and Broken Strings, has not yet been published.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"In Memory A-D\". \n* \"Sweeney's Men\"." .

The hypothesis of the operation was that people who did not have leave to remain would voluntarily depart if \"a near and present\" danger, such as being arrested, was made apparent. The pilot programme, which had the internal codename 'Operation Vaken', ran in the six London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Hounslow, and Redbridge from 22 July to 22 August 2013, and was part of the Home Office hostile environment policy. In October 2013, the evaluation report stated that 60 voluntary departures were believed to be directly related to 'Operation Vaken' and 65 more cases were \"currently being progressed to departure.\" The campaign was cancelled after a public outcry against it. British politicians including Nick Clegg, Vince Cable and Eric Pickles expressed concerns about the campaign. Nigel Farage described the advertisements as \"unpleasant.\" Yvette Cooper compared the slogans on the vans with slogans used by the National Front in the 1970s and the campaign was described by Diane Abbott as an example of dog-whistle politics, stating that \"It is not so much dog-whistle politics as an entire brass band ... It is akin to scrawling 'Paki go home' on the side of buildings. I don't believe this policy is going to achieve anything besides stoking fear and resentment.\"\n\nSee also\n\n* Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom \n* Racism in the UK Conservative Party\n\nReferences\n" .

DeBose. The film focuses on cultural language and practices that negatively impact the development of a healthy sense of self. The filmmaker's commentary asserts a criticism of the way wavy hair, lighter skin and a slender nose are still considered more attractive in the black community in light of historical and contemporary movements which have sought to liberate black self-esteem. As a practicing and teaching sociologist, the filmmaker sought to illuminate the notion of symbolic violence through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu and spark conversation not just in the black community but all other communities as well. Cultural practices which value some features but not others are issues common to every family and every community. For the filmmaker this is an issue of valuing and finding beauty in every human being.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film begins with a series of outdoor shots narrated by the filmmaker. The viewer follows her fuzzy form as she approaches the camera and tells a story of people remarking on the features they hope her unborn child will be born with. The film continues with a collection of personal stories juxtaposed against discussion and analysis from professionals and academics. Viewers get glimpses of the filmmaker's pregnant form as she travels through the landscape. The film ends with the sight of the filmmaker's child and a quote by bell hooks on shame and the life cycle.\n\nRelease\nThe film had its Chicago debut at the Black Harvest Film Festival on August 22, 2011.\n\nScreenings & Awards\n\n* 2012 - This film was an official selection at the Langston Hughes African American Film Festival in Seattle, WA. \n* 2012 - This film was an official selection at the San Francisco Black Film Festival. \n* 2012- This film was awarded Second Place for Best Documentary at the Central Illinois Feminist Film Festival\n\nReviews\nThe film was reviewed and recommended by Video Librarian in their 2013 January/February online issue.\n\nReferences\n\n* hooks, b 2003.

Ted is elated to be asked, but as he fears that his fellow priests Dougal and Jack would embarrass him, he tells the producer that he is the only priest on Craggy Island, and arranges to meet the television reporter at \"The Field\", one of the least-rocky areas on the island. As the day of the interview arrives, Dougal is excited about attending \"Fun Land\", a funfair that has been set up on \"The Field\". Ted tells Dougal to take Jack in his wheelchair for a walk along the cliffs while he goes to meet the reporter at the fair; however, Dougal and Jack soon appear at the fair, Dougal claiming that the cliffs were \"closed\" and \"gone\" due to erosion as an excuse to attend the fair. Ted, who has yet to meet the reporter, unsuccessfully tries to usher Dougal and Jack away. Jack soon takes off on his own while Dougal is distracted, and Ted is forced to look for him, finding him asleep on a park bench. Ted sits down with him, but is too late as he discovers that the bench is part of the \"Crane of Death\" ride, and is lifted high into the air. From his vantage point, Ted sees that Dougal has been found by the television reporter, and since Ted said he was the only priest on the island, the reporter mistakes Dougal for Ted. In his lament, Ted falls off the bench to the ground. Later, a heavily-bandaged Ted watches the television interview along with Dougal, Jack and Mrs Doyle at the parochial house. Ted cringes as, during the interview, Dougal talks about his doubts about Christianity and organised religion, while the on-screen caption reads \"Father Ted Crilly\". Jack sees Dougal on the TV set and angrily hurls a wine bottle at it like he did earlier in the episode.\n\nProduction\nWhile this was the first Father Ted episode broadcast, it was not always intended to be; the writers originally planned to air \"The Passion of Saint Tibulus\" first, but later decided that \"'Good Luck, Father Ted'\" would make a better introduction. Linehan makes a non-speaking cameo appearance, goading the \"fierce man\" on the stepladder at Funland. Mathews also makes a cameo as the voice on the Funland intercom; the voice Mathews adopts here is the one he used while playing \"Father Ted\" in a stand-up routine he performed prior to the series's creation.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"\"Good Luck, Father Ted\"\" on IMDb wikiquote:en:Father Ted S01E01 Good Luck, Father Ted" .

'Axe Handle!'\" (Norwegian: \"God dag, mann!\" \"Økseskaft!\") is a Norwegian folktale, collected by Asbjørnsen and Moe.\n\nPlot\nA deaf or hard of hearing ferryman has a wife, two sons and a daughter. They fritter away all their money, and leave him to pay the bill when their credit runs out. He sees the bailiff coming in the distance and decides to be clever and prepare his answers ahead of time. He reasons that the first thing the man will ask will be about what he is carving. He will say that it is an axe handle. He thinks that the other questions will be about the length of the axe handle, his ferry, his mare and the way to the cowshed. However, the first thing the bailiff says is \"Good day, fellow!\" He replies \"Axe handle!\", thinking himself clever. Next the bailiff asks how far it is to the inn. \"Up to this knot!\" he replies, pointing to the axe handle. The bailiff shakes his head and stares at him. \"Where is your wife, man?\" he says. \"I'm going to tar her,\" says the ferryman. \"She's lying on the beach, cracked at both ends.\" \"Where is your daughter?\" \"Oh, she's in the stable, big with foal,\" he says, still thinking himself clever. The bailiff finally gets angry with him and shouts, \"Go to the devil, fool that you are!\" \"Oh, it's not far away, when you're over the hill, you're almost there,\" says the man.\n\nInfluence\nThe phrase \"Goddag mann, økseskaft!\" (Good day fellow axe handle) has become a common idiom for a non sequitur, not just in Norway but also the rest of Scandinavia (\"Goddag, yxskaft!\" in Swedish, \"Goddag mand, økseskaft!\" in Danish and \"Hyvää päivää, kirvesvartta!\" in Finnish). The folktale was later published in the widely used Swedish elementary school book  by Anna Maria Roos in 1912. A similar tale appears in a 1985 collection of folktales given an erotic twist, by .\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Økse-skaft The Danish Dictionary (in Danish) \n* Kjell Nedrelid (12 November 1994). \"God dag, mann! -- Økseskaft\".

In this novel, Kinsey Millhone goes under cover to help break up an insurance fraud ring in Los Angeles led by Raymond Maldonado. She infiltrates the ring by befriending Maldonado's former girlfriend Bibianna Diaz. In the process she meets up with a former school mate and ex cop, Jimmy Tate. This novel earned a place on the New York Times hard-cover best-seller list just two weeks after initial publication. The title is similar to that of the fictional novel \"H as in Homicide\" portrayed as a work written by Ernesta Snoop of the Snoop Sisters in the 1972 television movie that spawned a series.\n\nPlot summary\nThese are troubling times for California Fidelity, the insurance company for whom Kinsey Millhone does occasional freelance work in return for office space. First, a recent employee and friend of Kinsey's, Parnell Perkins, is shot and killed—and the police investigation seems curiously lacking in results. Second, in the wake of poor profit figures, company troubleshooter Gordon Titus (or 'tight-ass' as he is immediately nicknamed) arrives to shake things up. The informal arrangement with Kinsey seems high on his list of targets. In the new mood of nervous efficiency prevalent at CFI pending Titus's arrival, Kinsey is passed the claim file of Bibianna Diaz to investigate for possible fraud. Kinsey assumes a false identity as Hannah Moore in an attempt to befriend Bibianna, who, by co-incidence, is in a relationship with a former schoolmate and police-academy associate of Kinsey's, Jimmy Tate, recently relieved of police duties on the grounds of corruption. Bibianna has problems too, it seems: her former boyfriend Raymond Maldonaldo, of whom she is—rightly, as it turns out—terrified, is the jealous type and is hunting her down. Kinsey realises that a CFI colleague has inadvertently given away information on Bibianna to Raymond's gang, and things come to a head while she is out drinking with Bibianna and Tate. Raymond's brother Chago and his girlfriend Dawna accost Bibianna; and in the fracas that ensues, Tate shoots and kills Chago. Bibianna is taken into custody, Kinsey deliberately sticking to her in order to cement their relationship. Kinsey's enforced overnight stay in the police 'tank' is interrupted by Lieutenant Dolan, who has a job offer for her: Raymond is the head of a huge insurance fraud gang, and the police want Kinsey to use her new position as Bibianna's confidante to get the evidence they need; there seems to be a leak somewhere in the police department, and they need someone unconnected whom they can trust to bring Raymond to justice. Kinsey withdraws her initial gut refusal when Dolan tells her Raymond killed Parnell but that they have been stalling the murder investigation in order not to jeopardize the longstanding fraud case. Kinsey agrees to help out of a sense of duty to Parnell; but the police plan to have Kinsey wired for her own protection goes awry, and she is left to fend for herself. Thus begins a dangerous and stifling few days for Kinsey, undercover and up to her neck in a criminal ring headed by a deluded killer. Raymond effectively keeps both Kinsey and Bibianna under house arrest in Los Angeles, with the aid of his second in command, Luis. Raymond can't accept Bibianna's rejection of him and is determined to force her into marriage. The snag in the plan, which Bibianna doesn't dare confess, is that she has actually just married Tate. Tensions run high, while Kinsey learns much about the car insurance fraud business, keeps her eyes open, and eventually establishes the leak is a clerk at the County Sheriff's office, whose father is a crooked doctor heavily involved in Raymond's ring. Matters come to a head when Bibianna escapes and is pursued almost to her death by one of Raymond's henchmen. Visiting her in the hospital, the doctor inadvertently lets slip to Raymond that Bibianna's next of kin is her husband, Jimmy Tate. Enraged, Raymond shoots Jimmy. Kinsey sets off in hot pursuit and receives unexpected help from Luis, who turns out to be an undercover LAPD cop. Kinsey makes it back to Santa Teresa in the nick of time for her friend Vera Lipton's wedding. Both Bibianna and Tate survive; but despite her success in wrapping up the insurance fraud claim, Kinsey is fired from CFI by Gordon Titus.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective who is hired to investigate insurance fraud and the people who perpetrate it.\n\nReviews\n\n\nPublication history\nWith a first printing of 170,000 copies, this book earned a place on the New York Times hard-cover best-seller list just two weeks after initial publication.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

Known for his clean comedy routines, Jones became so recognizable for his use of the word \"hamburger\" at the end of jokes or as a substitution for profanity, often stretching the syllables, that he soon adopted it as his stage name. Although the origins of this shtick have not been well documented, a brief biography by his booking agent claims: Comedian Hamburger is on a mission to let people know they are not living right. In doing so, Hamburger tries not to use profanity, like gentlemen of the old west who does not swear in front of the ladies. Instead, comedian Alonzo Jones has substituted profanity with one word.....HAMBURGER. Although he is said to have performed on Showtime at the Apollo, BET's Teen Summit, ComicView, and a few others following his Def Comedy Jam sets, Jones has rarely been seen on television since, except for two appearances on Byron Allen's Comics Unleashed seven years apart, nearly a decade after his last performance on Def Comedy Jam. Despite this, Jones continues to perform stand-up, appearing on tour as recently as May 2019.\n\nPersonal life\nOver the years, Jones befriended numerous comedians, including Uncle Jimmy Mack, whom he claimed had contacted him after beginning a \"relationship with the Lord\".\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* \"Came Na Gedown\", a track on the Odd Squad album Fadanuf Fa Erybody!!, references Jones by ending a line with \"hamburger\". \n* Artie Lange frequently referred to Jones on his former podcast, The Artie Quitter Podcast. \n* During one episode of Opie and Anthony, the hosts dedicated a significant portion of their discussion towards \"catchphrase comedians\" after recalling Jones' routine. \n* Jones' use of \"hamburger\" was parodied by Kenan Thompson, as fictional comedian David \"Beef Jelly\" Winfield, in the Saturday Night Live recurring sketch \"Kings of Catchphrase Comedy\". \n* in Family Guy episode Scammed Yankees the soldier uses the “hamburger” phrase while talking to the hostages.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"Hamburger\" Jones on IMDb \n* \"Def Comedy Jam: Alonzo \"Hamburger\" Jones\" on YouTube \n* \"Alonzo Hamburger Jones, Def Comedy Jam, Family Guy\" on YouTube \n* \"Hamburger the Comedian at Linwood Diner\" on YouTube \n* Brawley, Eddie (May 31, 2016). \"Hamburger Jones, Unique in the Game\".

Weiland, known for his roles as the lead singer in Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver, released his first album, 12 Bar Blues in 1998. Ten years later, \"Happy\" in Galoshes served as the official follow-up. Two versions have been released, a single disc and double disc deluxe version—the deluxe edition offers a second disc of 10 extra tracks. The album was released November 25, 2008 on Weiland's own Softdrive Records. Produced by Doug Grean and Scott Weiland, with select tracks recorded by Steve Albini, the album features guest appearances by Paul Oakenfold and No Doubt members Adrian Young, Tony Kanal, and Tom Dumont. Oakenfold appears on a cover of David Bowie's \"Fame.\" Weiland has cited Bowie as one of his main influences.\n\nMusical style and lyrics\nIn an interview with The Pulse of Radio regarding the album, Weiland stated:\"It'll definitely be a sonic journey like the first album was, a little bit more focused since I'm not on a narcotic journey like I was on the last one. But, you know, still sort of all over the map, because my influences are so wide and varied.\" In an interview with MTV News, Weiland stated that the songs on \"Happy\" In Galoshes were inspired by the death of his brother, Michael (who also played drums on a song on the album), and Weiland's separation from his wife of eight years, .\n\nDevelopment\n\"Happy\" in Galoshes was originally reported to be a double album, but in actuality, it is a single album that is being offered in a deluxe edition. On September 17, 2008, Spin.com posted an exclusive stream of \"Paralysis\", and the track \"Missing Cleveland\" was posted on Weiland's MySpace site. On October 24, Spin also posted another new song, \"Crash\". On October 27, rockdirt.com released the video for \"Paralysis\", which features actress Paz de la Huerta. On November 18, the album became available to preview on Scott Weiland's MySpace page. A series of 4 webisodes directed by  were released on scottweiland.com to promote the single \"Crash\". \"Missing Cleveland\" was the first single released from the album on November 11. On February 17, it was announced that fans could vote for the album's second single. The candidates for the voting are \"Paralysis\", \"Blind Confusion\", and \"Killing Me Sweetly.\"\n\nReception\n\"Happy\" in Galoshes debuted at #97 on the Billboard 200, selling 10,500 copies in its first week. The album received a 3.5/5 score from Rolling Stone magazine, and a four out of a possible five from Allmusic. Entertainment Weekly wasn't as approving, giving it a C- score.\n\nTrack listing\nOctober 11, 2008, Amazon.com listed the album on its website.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Hello,_World!%22_program?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "A \"Hello, World!\" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message \"Hello, World!\". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.\n\nHistory\nWhile small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase \"Hello, World!\" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language. The example program in that book prints \"hello, world\", and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial: main( ) {        printf(\"hello, world\n\");} In the above example, the main( ) function defines where the program should start executing. The function body consists of a single statement, a call to the printf function, which stands for \"print formatted\". This function will cause the program output whatever is passed to it as the parameter, in this case the string hello, world, followed by a newline character. The C language version was preceded by Kernighan's own 1972 A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B, where the first known version of the program is found in an example used to illustrate external variables: main( ) {    extern a, b, c;    putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar('!*n');} a 'hell';b 'o, w';c 'orld'; The program also prints hello, world! on the terminal, including a newline character. The phrase is divided into multiple variables because in B, a character constant is limited to four ASCII characters. The previous example in the tutorial printed hi! on the terminal, and the phrase hello, world! was introduced as a slightly longer greeting that required several character constants for its expression. The Jargon File claims that \"Hello, World!\" originated instead with BCPL (1967). This claim is supposedly supported by the archived notes of the inventors of BCPL, Brian Kernighan at Princeton and Martin Richards at Cambridge.\n\nVariations\n\"Hello, World!\" programs vary in complexity between different languages. In some languages, particularly scripting languages, the \"Hello, World!\" program can be written as a single statement, while in others (particularly many low-level languages) there can be many more statements required. For example, in Python, to print the string Hello, World! followed by a newline, one need only write print(\"Hello, World!\"). In contrast, the equivalent code in C++ [1] requires the import of the input/output software library, the manual declaration of an entry point, and the explicit instruction that the output string should be sent to the standard output stream. Generally, programming languages that give the programmer more control over the machine will result in more complex \"Hello, World\" programs. The phrase \"Hello World!\" has seen various deviations punctuation and casing, such as the presence of the comma and exclamation mark, and the capitalization of the leading H and W. Some devices limit the format to specific variations, such as all-capitalized versions on systems that support only capital letters, while some esoteric programming languages may have to print a slightly modified string. For example, the first non-trivial Malbolge program printed \"HEllO WORld\", this having been determined to be good enough. Other human languages have been used as the output; for example, a tutorial for the Go programming language outputted both English and Chinese characters, demonstrating the programming language's built-in Unicode support. Some languages change the functionality of the \"Hello, World!\" program while maintaining the spirit of demonstrating a simple example. Functional programming languages, such as Lisp, ML and Haskell, tend to substitute a factorial program for \"Hello, World!\", as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize I/O, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects. Languages otherwise capable of printing \"Hello, World!\" (Assembly, C, VHDL) may also be used in , where text output is either difficult (requiring additional components or communication with another computer) or nonexistent. For devices such as microcontrollers, field-programmable gate arrays, and CPLDs, \"Hello, World!\" may thus be substituted with a blinking LED, which demonstrates timing and interaction between components. The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions provide the \"Hello, World!\" program through their software package manager systems, which can be invoked with the command hello. It serves as a sanity check and a simple example of installing a software package. For developers, it provides an example of creating a .deb package, either traditionally or using debhelper, and the version of hello used, GNU Hello, serves as an example of writing a GNU program. Variations of the \"Hello, World!\" program that produce a graphical output (as opposed to text output) have also been shown. Sun demonstrated a \"Hello, World!\" program in Java based on scalable vector graphics, and the XL programming language features a spinning Earth \"Hello, World!\" using 3D computer graphics. Mark Guzdial and Elliot Soloway have suggested that the \"hello, world\" test message may be outdated now that graphics and sound can be manipulated as easily as text.\n\nTime to hello world\n\"Time to hello world\" (TTHW) is the time it takes to author a \"Hello, World!\" program in a given programming language. This is one measure of a programming language's ease-of-use; since the program is meant as a introduction for people unfamiliar with the language, a more complex \"Hello, World!\" program may indicate that the programming language is less approachable. The concept has been extended beyond programming languages to APIs, as a measure of how simple it is for a new developer to get a basic example working; a faster time indicates an easier API for developers to adopt.\n\nSee also\n\n* \"99 Bottles of Beer\" as used in computer science \n* Foobar \n* Bad Apple!! used a graphic equivalent to \"Hello, World!\" for old hardware \n* Java Pet Store \n* Just another Perl hacker \n* List of basic computer science topics \n* Trabb Pardo-Knuth algorithm\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Rösler, Wolfram. \"Hello World Collection\". helloworldcollection.de. \n* \"Hello world/Text\".

It was the second instalment of his \"Berlin Trilogy\" recorded with producers Brian Eno and Tony Visconti, following Low (released earlier that year) and preceding Lodger (1979). Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. \"Heroes\" continued the ambient experiments of its predecessor, albeit with more pop elements and passionate lyrics and featured contributions from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. \"Heroes\" was the most well-received work of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy by music critics on release, and was named Album of the Year by NME and Melody Maker. It was also a commercial success, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track remains one of Bowie's best known and acclaimed songs. An altered and obscured version of the album's cover artwork later appeared as the artwork for Bowie's 2013 album The Next Day. The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set.\n\nProduction and style\nRecorded at Hansa Tonstudio in what was then West Berlin, \"Heroes\" reflected the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city. Co-producer Tony Visconti considered it \"one of my last great adventures in making albums. The studio was about 500 yards [460 metres] from the Berlin Wall. Red Guards would look into our control-room window with powerful binoculars.\" Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk had name-checked Bowie on the title track of Trans-Europe Express, and he again paid tribute to his Krautrock influences: the title is a nod to the track \"Hero\" on the album Neu! '75 by the German band Neu! – whose guitarist Michael Rother had originally been approached to play on the album – while \"V-2 Schneider\" is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk's Florian Schneider. Despite the German influences, the album was recorded with Bowie's British and American collaborators, with no input from German musicians other than backing vocalist Antonia Maass. Masayoshi Sukita's cover photo was inspired by German artist Erich Heckel's Roquairol. Bowie said that the quotation marks in the title \"indicate a dimension of irony about the word 'heroes' or about the whole concept of heroism\". Brian Eno instigated Robert Fripp's involvement. \"I got a phone call when I was living in New York in July 1977,\" the guitarist recalled. \"It was Brian Eno. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. David said, 'Would you be interested in playing some hairy rock 'n' roll guitar?' I said, 'Well, I haven't really played for three years – but,if you're prepared to take a risk, so will I.' Shortly afterwards, a first-class ticket on Lufthansa arrived.\" Upon arriving at the studio, and suffering from jet lag, Fripp recorded a guitar part for \"Beauty and the Beast\": this first take was used in the song's final mix. Although \"Heroes\" continued Bowie's work in electronic and ambient music styles and included a number of dark and atmospheric instrumentals such as \"Sense of Doubt\" and \"Neuköln\", it was regarded as a highly passionate and positive artistic statement, particularly after the often melancholy Low. The lyrics for \"Joe the Lion\", written and recorded at the microphone \"in less than an hour\" according to Visconti, typified the improvisational nature of the recording. Eno employed his Oblique Strategies cards during the recording of the album. Stories suggest they were used during the recording of instrumentals such as \"Sense of Doubt\".\n\nRelease and impact\nRCA Records marketed \"Heroes\" with the slogan \"There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie ...\" It enjoyed a positive critical reception on release in late 1977, Melody Maker and NME both naming it \"Album of the Year\". It reached No. 3 in the UK and stayed in the charts for 26 weeks, but was less successful in the US where it peaked at No. 35. The album was released in Germany with the title track renamed \"\"Heroes\"/\"Helden\"\" and partly in German. An early instance of the album's enduring influence is John Lennon's comment in 1980 that, when making his album Double Fantasy, his ambition was to \"do something as good as \"Heroes\".\" Rolling Stone highlighted Eno's contribution, contending that after Bowie's \"auteurist exploitation\" of the former on Low, \"Heroes\" \"prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie's dramatic instincts and Eno's unshakable sonic serenity\". Several songs from the album were played live on Bowie's Isolar II Tour in 1978, released on the live album Stage the same year, and again from a different venue in 2018 with Welcome to the Blackout. Philip Glass adapted a classical suite, \"Heroes\" Symphony, from this album as a companion to his earlier Low Symphony. The title track has been covered by numerous artists, for example as an encore by subsequent incarnations of King Crimson, and Billy Mackenzie sang \"The Secret Life of Arabia\" in 1982 for the B.E.F. LP Music of Quality and Distinction. Several tracks were used in the film Christiane F. Bowie performed as himself in the film. The cover of Bowie's 2013 album, The Next Day, is an altered and obscured version of the \"Heroes\" cover. This version has \"Heroes\" crossed out and Bowie's face obscured by an opaque white box reading \"The Next Day\".\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nOriginal release\nAll tracks are written by David Bowie except where noted. \n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1–10 on CD reissues.\n\nReissues\n\"Heroes\" was first released on CD by RCA Records in the mid-1980s. It was reissued in 1991 by Rykodisc with two bonus tracks. The 1991 edition was released in the UK on CD, cassette and LP by EMI Records, and was subsequently rereleased on a numbered 20-bit SBM AU20 Gold CD edition. A further CD release in 1999 by EMI/Virgin, without bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound. In 2017, the album was remastered for the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set released by Parlophone that September. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately in February 2018. A volume shift in the 2017 remaster of the song \"Heroes\" received ire from fans and critics, but Parlophone proceeded to describe as intentional and unalterable, because of damages in the original master tapes. After the critical voices would not lessen, a statement was released on the official Bowie website announcing corrected replacement disks for the \"Heroes\" CD and LP; the replacement disc offer lasted until June 2018. The amended remaster featured on the replacement discs was also used for the standalone CD and LP release of \"Heroes\" in February 2018.\n\nPersonnel\n\n* David Bowie – vocals, keyboards, guitars, saxophone, koto, tambourine, backing vocals, producer \n* Brian Eno – synthesizers, keyboards, guitar treatments \n* Robert Fripp – lead guitar \n* Carlos Alomar – rhythm guitar \n* George Murray – bass guitar \n* Dennis Davis – drums, percussion \n* Tony Visconti – percussion, backing vocals, producer \n* Antonia Maass – backing vocals \n* Colin Thurston – engineer\n\nCharts and certifications\n\n\nNotes\n" .

It was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno, produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, and recorded in July and August 1977 at Hansa Studio by the Wall. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his 12th studio album of the same name, backed with the song \"V-2 Schneider\". A product of Bowie's \"Berlin\" period, the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his signature songs. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. \"'Heroes'\" has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"Rebel Rebel\". Inspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the Berlin Wall, the song tells the story of two lovers, one from East and one from West Berlin. Bowie's performance of \"'Heroes'\" on June 6, 1987, at the German Reichstag in West Berlin has been considered a catalyst to the later fall of the Berlin Wall. Following his death in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\". \"'Heroes'\" has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs of all time\" compiled by the music publications; Rolling Stone named the song the 46th greatest ever, and NME named it the 15th greatest. Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that \"'Heroes'\" \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\".\n\nTitle and lyrics\nThe song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"Hero\" by German krautrock band Neu!, whom Bowie and Eno admired. It was one of the early tracks recorded during the album sessions, but remained an instrumental until towards the end of production. The quotation marks in the title of the song, a deliberate affectation, were designed to impart an ironic quality on the otherwise romantic or triumphant words and music. Producer Tony Visconti took credit for inspiring the image of the lovers kissing \"by the wall\", when he and backing vocalist Antonia Maass (Maaß) embraced in front of Bowie as he looked out of the Hansa Studio window. Bowie claimed that the protagonists were based on an anonymous young couple, but Visconti, who was married to Mary Hopkin at the time, contends that Bowie was protecting him and his affair with Maass. Bowie confirmed this in 2003.\n\nMusic\nBowie said that the \"plodding tempo and rhythm\" were inspired by the Velvet Underground song \"I'm Waiting for the Man\". Richard Buskin of Sound on Sound described \"'Heroes'\" as a \"highly experimental piece of art rock\". The music, co-written by Bowie and Eno, has been likened to a Wall of Sound production, a forceful and noisy arrangement of guitars, percussion and synthesizers. Eno said the song always \"sounded grand and heroic\" and that he had \"that very word – heroes – in my mind\" even before Bowie wrote the lyrics. The backing track consists of a conventional arrangement of piano, bass guitar, rhythm guitar and drums. The other parts consist of synthesizer parts by Eno using an EMS VCS3 to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three oscillators, producing a juddering effect. In addition, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to feed back and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the pitch of the feedback. Visconti mixed out Dennis Davis' kick drum, stating that the track \"seemed to plod\" with it but had a more energetic feel without it.\n\nVocal gating progression\nBowie's vocal was recorded with a \"multi-latch\" system devised by Visconti that creatively misused gating. Three microphones were used to capture the vocal, with one microphone nine inches from Bowie, one 20 feet away and one 50 feet away. Each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered. As the music built, Bowie was forced to sing at increased volumes to overcome the gating effect, leading to an increasingly impassioned vocal performance as the song progresses. Jay Hodgson writes, \"Bowie's performance thus grows in intensity precisely as ever more ambience infuses his delivery until, by the final verse, he has to shout just to be heard ... The more Bowie shouts just to be heard, in fact, the further back in the mix Visconti's multi-latch system pushes his vocal tracks, creating a stark metaphor for the situation of Bowie's doomed lovers\".\n\nRelease\n\"'Heroes'\" was released in a variety of languages and lengths (\"a collector's wet dream\" in the words of NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray). In contrast to the bewildering audio situation, the video (directed by Nick Ferguson) was a stark and simple affair, the singer captured performing the song in what appeared to be a single take with multiple cameras, swaying in front of a spotlight that created a monotone and near-silhouette effect.\n\nReception and legacy\nDespite a large promotional push, including Bowie's first live Top of the Pops appearance since 1973, \"'Heroes'\" reached only number 24 in the UK charts, and failed to make the US Billboard Hot 100.In Italy, the song was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. Writing for NME on its release, Charlie Gillett slated the record, saying: \"Well he had a pretty good run for our money, for a guy who was no singer. But I think his time has been and gone, and this just sounds weary. Then again, maybe the ponderous heavy riff will be absorbed on the radio, and the monotonous feel may just be hypnotic enough to drag people into buying it. I hope not.\" Despite the poor review it featured at number 6 in the NME's end of year critics poll for 1977. Later assessments were more favourable. In February 1999, Q magazine listed \"'Heroes'\" as one of the 100 greatest singles of all time as voted by the readers. In March 2005, the same magazine placed it at number 56 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2004, Rolling Stone rated \"'Heroes'\" number 46 in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was included in 2008's The Pitchfork Media 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present. John J. Miller of National Review rated \"'Heroes'\" number 21 on a list of \"the 50 greatest conservative rock songs\" due to its anti-Soviet political context. It has also become a gay anthem. Uncut placed \"'Heroes'\" at number 1 in its 30 greatest Bowie songs in 2008. Moby has said that \"'Heroes'\" is one of his favourite songs ever written, calling it \"inevitable\" that his music would be influenced by the song, and Dave Gahan, the lead singer of Depeche Mode, was hired into the band when band founder Vince Clarke heard him singing \"'Heroes'\" at a jam session. Bowie regularly performed the song in concert.\n\nLater use of the song\n\n* In 1979 Heroes was used in Chris Petit's film Radio On. \n* Heroes is the main track of the 1981 German movie Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo, for which Bowie provided the music. \n* The song was played during the party scene in the 2001 film Antitrust. \n* This song featured as exclusive song on Guitar Rock Tour for mobile platform (iOS & Java ME) in 2008 \n* In 2009, the song was played over the closing credits of both the documentary The Cove, and What Goes Up, and also featured in that film, important to the plot's message. \n* In May 2010, the song was played over the extended closing credits of the final episode of Ashes to Ashes, in keeping with the various David Bowie allusions throughout that series (and its predecessor Life on Mars). \n* In 2012 the track was played as athletes from Great Britain entered the Olympic Stadium during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, and after medal ceremonies during the Olympics. It was also used as the Great Britain Paralympic team entered the stadium during the opening ceremony on 29 August 2012. \n* The same year, it was featured in the film The Perks of Being a Wallflower. First heard on a pick-up truck radio by the main characters, the song is important to both \"flying through the tunnel\" scenes and played over the closing credits. \n* In 2013, the song was featured in the Daniel Radcliffe horror fantasy film, Horns. \n* In 2014, the song was featured in the premiere trailer for the Brazilian film Praia do Futuro. The song was also played in \"You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee\", an episode of The Simpsons as Lisa is trying to figure out how to make Homer into a hero for a speech contest at school. \n* In the days following Bowie's death in January 2016, the song was streamed on Spotify more than any other Bowie song. On Twitter the German Foreign Office paid homage to Bowie for \"helping to bring down the wall\". It reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK after Bowie's death. \n* In 2017, the song was played at the end of the series finale of animated television series Regular Show. \n* In 2019, a cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" by Peter Gabriel (which has been used by the show once before, in episode 3 of the first season) was played at the end of Stranger Things' season 3, episode 8 \"Chapter Eight: The Battle of Starcourt\". It was also used in the 2020 Star Trek: Short Treks episode Children of Mars. \n* The 2019 film, Jojo Rabbit uses Bowie's German version of the song (\"Helden\") during the final scene and closing credits.\n\nUse in advertising\nThe song has been used in advertising, gracing efforts by Microsoft, Kodak, CGU Insurance, HBO Olé (HBO Latin America) and various sporting promoters throughout the world. It was also used as the intro to the video game NHL 99, released in 1998. \"'Heroes'\" also appears as downloadable content in the music video game series Rock Band in a three-song pack along with other Bowie songs \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"Queen Bitch\". The Australian television mockumentary We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year (title outside Australia: The Nominees) took its title from \"'Heroes'\". A cover of the single was used as ITV's theme song for its coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAccolades\nN/A designates unordered lists.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n7\" vinyl\n\n* RCA / PB 11121\n\n12\" vinyl\n\n* RCA / JD-11151 (US promo) \n* RCA / PC-9821 (Germany)\n\nProduction credits\n\n* Producers: \n* Tony Visconti \n* David Bowie \n* Musicians: \n* David Bowie: lead vocals, piano, ARP Solina String Ensemble, Chamberlin, percussion \n* Robert Fripp: lead guitar \n* Carlos Alomar: rhythm guitar \n* George Murray: bass guitar \n* Dennis Davis: drums \n* Brian Eno: EMS VCS 3 synthesizer, guitar treatments \n* Tony Visconti: backing vocals, tambourine, tape reel as percussion\n\nCharts and certifications\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nLive versions\n\n* Prior to the single release of \"'Heroes'\", Bowie first performed the song on the final episode of friend Marc Bolan's Granada Television series Marc (filmed 7 September 1977, broadcast 28 September 1977, after Bolan's funeral). This particular version, released as a 7\" picture disc, on 22 September 2017, has an alternate backing track that was recorded with Bolan playing lead guitar and the T.Rex line up of Dino Dines on keyboards, and the rhythm section of Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums. Coincidentally, prior to joining T.Rex, Flowers and Newman were a part of Bowie's rhythm section on the Diamond Dogs album and its tour, documented on the live album David Live. \n* Bowie performed the song when he appeared on Bing Crosby's 1977 Christmas TV special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas. In the performance, filmed on 11 September 1977, Bowie sang over a prerecorded backing track. \n* Performances from the Isolar II Tour have been released on Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018). \n* Bowie performed the song live on his Serious Moonlight Tour in 1983, as seen in the 1984 concert video of that tour and as heard on the live album Serious Moonlight (Live '83), which was part of the 2018 box set Loving the Alien (1983–1988) and was released separately in 2019. \n* The rendition at Live Aid in 1985 has been described as \"the best version of 'Heroes' [Bowie] had ever sung\". This performance featured Thomas Dolby on keyboards. \n* Bowie performed the song live on his Glass Spider Tour, as seen in the 1988 concert video of that tour. \n* The song was performed at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992 by Bowie, Mick Ronson and Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon – the surviving members of Queen. \n* An acoustic version of the song was played in 1996 at The Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, and later released on The Bridge School Benefit Concert album. \n* Bowie's 25 June 2000 performance of the song at the Glastonbury Festival was released in 2018 on Glastonbury 2000. \n* The song was performed by Bowie at The Concert for New York City on 20 October 2001. Before Bowie opened the concert he was asked to perform \"'Heroes'\". He said it wasn't appropriate as it was a love song, so he opened with a solo version of Paul Simon's \"America\", and then performed \"'Heroes'\" with the house band led by Paul Shaffer. \n* Bowie performed the song live during the A Reality Tour in 2003, and a performance from November of that year was released on a DVD in 2004, and later on an album, released in 2010.\n\nOther releases\n\n* The edited 7-inch single, running at 3:32 mins and backed with \"V-2 Schneider\", was released separately in English, French («Héros») and German („Helden“). All three of these cuts plus \"V-2 Schneider\" were released together as an Australian 4-track 7-inch. \n* The complete English version as it appeared on the album was released as a Spanish 12-inch single. \n* A version featuring the German single edit spliced into the second half of the full-length English track (\"Heroes\"/„Helden“) appeared on the German pressing of the LP and is also available on Bowie's soundtrack to the film Christiane F. and on the Rare album. A corresponding English/French version (\"Heroes\"/«Héros») appeared on the French pressing of the LP. \n* The song has appeared, almost invariably in single edit form, on numerous Bowie compilations: \n* Chameleon (Australia and New Zealand 1979) \n* The Best of Bowie (1980) \n* Fame and Fashion (1984) – album version \n* Sound + Vision (1989) – „Helden“ \n* Changesbowie (1990) \n* Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993 (1993) \n* The Singles Collection (1993) \n* The Best of David Bowie 1974/1979 (1998) \n* Best of Bowie (2002) – „Helden“ on German/Swiss/Austrian edition \n* The Platinum Collection (2005/2006) \n* Nothing Has Changed (2014) \n* Bowie Legacy (2016) \n* It was released as a picture disc in the RCA Life Time picture disc set. \n* The German („Helden“) and French («Héros») versions of the single, as well as the English/German (\"Heroes\"/„Helden“) and English/French (\"Heroes\"/«Héros») versions of the album track, were included on an EP in the 2017 boxed set A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982).

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Holy...%22?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Holy...!\" (for example \"Holy cow!\", \"Holy mackerel!\" or \"Holy smoke!\") is an exclamation of surprise used mostly in English-speaking countries. Robin of the Batman TV series is noted for his many catchphrase \"Holy...\" exclamations. The lines in the 1960s TV series were uttered by Burt Ward who played Robin, who delivered the exclamations in a nasal voice. Many of the camp quips are directly related to the plot; for example, \"Holy Graf Zeppelin!\" is uttered by Robin upon seeing an aerial balloon or \"Holy nipple rosettes\" upon seeing morris dancers.  In his cameo on the Arrowverse crossover \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", he exclaims, \"Holy crimson skies of death!\" while Earth-66 experiences red skies.\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to New York wellness expert Scott A. Morofsky, Robin would \"inevitably refer to an intense experience with a loud, 'Holy... Batman, what do we do now?'\". Bradley J. Ricca, comic book scholar at Case Western Reserve University, suggests that: \"Robin exists as a media entity inextricably linked with Batman and shares nearly as much ubiquity in American culture\". He considers Robin's famous \"Holy...\" catchphrases to have been grossly overused in the series, popularizing it in the American vernacular. Cartoons such as The Super Friends continued to make use of Robin and his catchphrases, \"spouting 'Holy' in front of every noun imaginable\" and Robin's exclamations still remain closely associated with his character in popular culture. American author David Shields notes how much in contrast Robin's \"Holy...\" outbursts, his alliteration and assonance, his fast riffs\" were to the laconic Batman. According to film critics Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan, Robin's quip \"Holey Rusted Metal!\" in Batman Forever was an \"explicit in-joke\". Camp humour, through Robin's exclamations and other circumstances in the Batman series, have led some commentators to speculate on homosexual undertones in the relationship between Batman and Robin. Image Entertainment paid homage to Robin's quips with the title \"Batman: Holy Batmania\" in a 2004 2-disc DVD release containing four documentaries discussing the sixties TV series.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Hope%22_is_the_thing_with_feathers_(poem)?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" is a lyric poem in ballad meter written by American poet Emily Dickinson, The manuscript of this poem appears in Fascicle 13, which Dickinson compiled around 1861. It is one of 19 poems included in the collection, in addition to the poem \"There's a certain Slant of light.\" With the discovery of Fascicle 13 after Dickinson's death by her sister, Lavinia Dickinson, \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" was subsequently published in 1891 in a collection of her works under the title Poems, which was edited and published by Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd.\n\nHistory of publication\n\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" was first compiled in one of Dickinson's hand-sewn fascicles, which was written during and put together in 1861. In the 1999 edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Reading Edition, R.W. Franklin changed the year of appearance from 1861, where the holograph manuscript exists, to 1862. It is listed in the appendix that poems numbered 272 to 498 were written during this year, which amounted to the third most poems Dickinson wrote in the span of years from 1860-1865, at 227. The edition that Dickinson included in the fascicle was text B, according to Franklin. No current holograph manuscript exists of the first written version of this selection. \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" first appeared in print in a second series of her poetry, titled Poems by Emily Dickinson, second series in 1891. It was published out of Boston. Upon the original publication, her poems were reassessed and transcribed by Thomas H. Jefferson in 1955. They became the first scholarly collection of Dickinson's work. His transcription of her works from her fascicles was taken from the earliest fair copy of her poetic works. Within the Johnson collection, \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" is poem number 254. Franklin, in his edition of her works, used the last fair copy of her poems. It is marked as number 314 in his collection and can be found under such in the Norton Anthology of Poetry.\n\nFascicle 13\nFascicle 13 is the bound edition of her written poetry that contains \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" written in Dickinson's hand. According to the work done by Franklin, there are similarities in the materials used for this fascicle and with Fascicles 11-13, 14, as well as Fascicles 9,11, and 12. Some distinct markers of Fascicle 13 include a woven-style of stationary, with paper that is cream in appearance with a blue rule line on it. It also is decorated in an embossed style that frames the page with \"a queen's head above the letter 'L'.\"  To view the holograph manuscript of this in person, the Houghton Library at Harvard University houses it.\n\nAnalysis\nIn her analysis of the poem, scholar Helen Vendler, states that the opening foot of the poem is \"reversed,\" adding more color and emphasis on the word \"Hope.\"  Dickinson implements the use of iambic meter for the duration of the poem to replicate that continuation of \"Hope's song through time.\" Most of Dickinson's poetry contains quatrains and runs in a hymnal meter, which maintains the rhythm of alternating between four beats and three beats during each stanza. \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" is broken into three stanzas, each set alternating containing alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, totaling in twelves lines altogether. In addition, despite Mr. Lin's theorizing, it is not actually about a bird.\n\nForm\nIn Victoria N. Morgan's text, Emily Dickinson and Hymnal Culture: Tradition and Experience, she writes that Dickinson's poetry may have been influenced by eighteenth-century hymn culture, such as Isaac Watts, and female hymnal writers, Phoebe Hinsdale Brown and Eliza Lee Follen. Morgan postulates that their works were introduced to Dickinson early in her life when she was attending church regularly. She believes that the \"simplicity\" of the hymnal form allowed room for Dickinson to make this \"an easy target for parody.\"\n\nTheme of poem\nThe poem calls upon the imagery of seafaring adventures with the use of the word \"Sea\" and \"Gale.\" Dickinson uses the metaphor of \"Hope\" being likened unto a bird that does not disappear when it encounters hardships or \"storms.\" Vendler writes that Dickinson enjoys \"the stimulus of teasing riddles,\" which is in use as she plays with the idea of \"Hope\" being a bird. Dickinson makes an allusion to \"Hope\" being something that does not disappear when the \"Gale\" and \"storm\" get worse and its song still sings on despite the intensity of whatever is attempting to unseat it. She also makes note that no matter what the speaker of the poem is doing, \"Hope\" does not leave even if they offer nothing in return to it.\n\nPunctuation\nThroughout the poem, Dickinson uses dashes liberally, ending nine lines out of twelve with them. In addition to the use of dashes, she employs capitalization of common nouns, such as \"Hope,\" \"Bird,\" and \"Extremity.\" Scholar Ena Jung writes that Dickinson's dashes are among the most \"widely contested diacriticals\" in contemporary literary discussions. John Lennard, in his Poetry Handbook, states that Dickinson's poems rely heavily her use of dashes, capitalizations of particular words and her line/stanza breaks, with \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" falling into that categorization. He continues on stating that her \"intense, [and] unexpected play\" with her use of capitalization and dashes makes her poetry \"memorable.\"  When reading the poem aloud, the dashes create caesura, causing the brief poem to be read in a staccato'd rhythm. Jung claims that the use of Dickinson's dashes in her poetry creates a \"visible breath\" to the speaker that is delivering the poetry.\n\nSymbolism\nIn her poem, Dickinson describes \"hope\" as a bird, which is being used as a metaphor for the idea of salvation. Through the Emily Dickinson Archive of her lexicon, Dickinson has nine variations of the word \"hope,\" which can be interpreted in multiple ways. Morgan writes that Dickinson often writes about birds when she is describing acts of worship, which coincides with the format of the hymn. Birds in Christian iconography are often represented as a dove. Dickinson uses many illusions to nature in her poems. Within this poem, she takes the image of the bird and the violence of weather to create a balance between the destructive and the beneficent. It is also a juxtaposition of the interior world and exterior, with the soul considered \"interior\" and the storms that attempt to dismantle hope being the \"exterior.\" Due to the riddle-like nature of her poems, as well as the extensive use of her lexicon, \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" can be interpreted through multiple shades of meaning.\n\nCritical reception\nDickinson's poems are lauded as mysterious and enigmatic and typically have a volta, or turn in topic, at the end, such as \"Because I could not stop for Death.\" \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers,\" while possessing a similar quality, is considered \"childlike\" by some critics due to the simplicity of the work. Vendler expands on this idea by stating it is also due to the way that Dickinson constructs her poems in quatrains and hymnal meter, which can be seen as simplistic. Morgan argues that because of Dickinson's \"antagonistic relation\" she has with nineteenth-century Christianity, the poet gives a \"reassessment of spirituality\" through this poem by the use of the image of the bird and the Christian conception of \"hope.\"\n\nDerivative works\n\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\" has been adapted to music to be performed by choirs. There are multiple versions of the song. Most notable of the adaptations is the Susan LaBarr version that was written for women's choir and intended to be accompanied by piano. Additional musical adaptations of the poem are also done by Robert Sieving and Emma Lou Diemer. Alternative country band, Trailer Bride, titled their final album, Hope Is a Thing with Feathers. The title of the album is a variant of the name of the poem. The title track of the album is an adaptation of the poem written by Dickinson, where she receives a writing credit.\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Emily Dickinson Archive \n* Poetry Foundation \n* Michigan State University's Children's Choir performing \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers \n* Trailer Bride's \"Hope is a Thing with Feathers" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22How's_my_driving%3F%22_sign?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "A \"how's my driving\" sign (or \"how is my driving\" or similar) is a decal posted or painted on a back of a fleet vehicle or other vehicle operated by an employee driver. The decal usually has a phone number or website address and other identifying information so that the public can call and report on the behavior of the vehicle's driver. Depending on the company, the phone number or website is monitored by the vehicle's owner or by a third-party company. Similar programs have also been implemented for vehicles driven by teenagers in hopes of improving the safety of teenage drivers and with drunk drivers.Use of \"How's My Driving\" regimes for systems other than traffic have been discussed, also in relation to eBay and Wikipedia. The purpose of the decal is to increase traffic safety, as those who know they are driving a vehicle with a decal would want to drive more safely in order to not draw complaints.\n\nFrequency of complaints\nAbout 10% of vehicles bearing this decal become the target of complaints. The most common complaints fielded are tailgating, improper lane changes, speeding, and running red lights, though it has been found that many bored motorists who have cell phones will call in petty complaints. A small percentage of calls are to compliment drivers.\n\nEffects\nStudies have found that vehicles displaying the decal are involved in 22% fewer accidents and result in a 52% reduction in accident-related costs. Some insurance companies offer discounts to fleets that display the decal. Other countries are starting to experiment with similar programs, for example Germany.\n\nEffects of complaints\nWhen a complaint is made, the receptionist who fields the complaint will generally ask for basic information regarding the vehicle and incident, such as the vehicle's description (e.g. a white van), the location of the incident, and the weather of the day. Truck companies use the reports to spot problem drivers. Complaints received by motorists may or may not affect the employment status of the operator of the vehicle. In the worst cases, complaints may result in a reprimand against the operator and possibly termination.\n\nReferences\n" .

The exact genus-level placement of this species is uncertain because it was not included in the revision of the genus Hylarana that saw what was then very broadly defined genus split into several distinct genera, with relatively few remaining in Hylarana sensu stricto. It is found in central and south Vietnam, eastern Cambodia, and southern Laos. The specific name attigua is derived from Latin attiguus meaning \"neighbor\". It refers to the similarity of this species to Indosylvirana milleti. Common name similar frog has been coined for this species.\n\nDescription\nAdult males measure 40–45 mm (1.6–1.8 in) and adult females 55–65 mm (2.2–2.6 in) in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is moderately stocky. The head is longer than it is broad and the snout is obtusely pointed, but rounded and projecting in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct, relatively larger in males than in females. The finger tips bear small discs. The toe discs are also small, but can be slightly larger than the fingers ones. The toes are partially webbed. There are conspicuous, continuous dorsolateral folds. Skin is dorsally granular with small tubercles, with larger tubercles on the sides. In many individuals, both males and females, the tubercles have white, spinose tips. Dorsal coloration is medium brown and may include small darker spots. A dark brown to black narrow band runs from the snout through the eye and the tympanum, becoming less defined in the temporal area. The upper lip has white to yellow stripe. The limbs have dark brown crossbars.\n\nHabitat and conservation\nThis species occurs in wet evergreen forests, typically along streams (including rapids and waterfalls), as well as mixed evergreen and deciduous forests with bamboo, at elevations of 152–1,280 m (499–4,199 ft) above sea level. Reproduction has been reported in standing water. It can be common in parts of its range. It is probably suffering the loss of forest habitats, although it appears to tolerate a degree of habitat modification. It is known from a number of protected areas.\n\nReferences\n" .

Lonnie has a case with which he wants Kinsey's help. Six years earlier, David Barney was acquitted of killing his estranged wife, talented but insecure society house-designer Isabelle Barney, by shooting her dead through the spy hole of her front door. David's desperation to rebuild the marriage after the split netted him an injunction for harassment; so he was the obvious suspect—particularly since he inherited Isabelle's multimillion-dollar business—but the prosecution could not make it stick. Now Isabelle's previous husband, Kenneth Voigt, is trying again in the civil courts in an attempt to secure the fortune for his and Isabelle's daughter Shelby; and Lonnie needs some evidence. The previous PI on the case, Morley Shine, has just died of a heart attack. Lonnie asks Kinsey to step in. Kinsey agrees and, knowing Morley of old, is surprised to find his files in a mess, with crucial witness statements missing. One new witness has come forward: Curtis MacIntyre, a habitual jailbird who shared a cell with Barney for a night and claims that Barney confessed to his guilt just after the acquittal. Kinsey is very doubtful of this story, especially when she finds out Curtis was in custody on another matter on the date in question. In trying to fill in the other blanks, she uncovers more evidence in Barney's favor than against him, not least that Barney appears to have a cast-iron alibi; he was the victim of a hit and run whilst out jogging at the time of the murder some miles away. Kinsey tracks down both the driver—Tippy, the daughter of Isabelle's best friend Rhe Parsons—and a witness who can swear that she knocked down Barney. Kinsey also finds out that Tippy, drunk and in her father's pick-up truck, was the perpetrator of a previous and fatal hit-and-run on the same night, the victim being an elderly man named Noah McKell. Kinsey realizes Morley was on the same track and begins to have suspicions about his death. She eventually establishes that Morley was poisoned by a pastry left at his office, a pastry made with lethal mushrooms. She also finds out that Kenneth Voigt has been paying Curtis 'expense money' for years, which casts further doubt on his testimony. Curtis comes up with an alternative story: according to him, the confession was actually made some time after the acquittal during a drunken evening at Barney's home. This sounds even more unlikely to Kinsey's skeptical ears. She begins to suspect that someone else from Isabelle's immediate circle might be the guilty party—Isabelle's sister Simone, Ken Voigt's new wife Francesca, or Isabelle's former business partner Peter Weidmann and/or his wife Yolanda. Meanwhile, at home, Kinsey’s octogenarian landlord, Henry Pitts, is entertaining his hypochondriac elder brother William. Both Henry and Kinsey are astonished to find romance beginning to bloom between William and Rosie. Rosie is the proprietor of Kinsey's local Hungarian tavern, which has recently been taken over as a favorite haunt by some local sports fans. Rosie charms William with her acceptance of his imagined illnesses. Back on the case, Kinsey has a sudden flash of inspiration after looking at the time gap between Tippy’s killing Mr. McKell and knocking down Barney. Tippy admits that, panic-stricken after the first accident, she went to confess what she had done to her 'aunt' Isabelle but did not get an answer at the door. Kinsey realises Barney's alibi is worthless: having just killed Isabelle, he could have hitched on Tippy's pick-up and then rolled off it later at an appropriate time in front of witnesses, to establish his alibi miles away. Kinsey's train of thought is interrupted by a call from Curtis, asking her to meet him at the bird refuge. He sounds terrified, and Kinsey suspects he has been taken hostage. She arranges for Jonah, her ex-boyfriend cop, to provide back-up and calls in at the office to pick up her gun on the way. Barney has anticipated that she would do this and is waiting for her, along with Curtis's corpse. They play a cat-and-mouse version of Russian roulette with their respective guns until Kinsey, in possession of a gun with an extra round in the chamber, emerges victorious, having shot and killed Barney.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator aids her attorney in a case he is defending.\n\nReviews\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2006 film Stranger than Fiction, the character Professor Jules Hilbert is shown reading a plastic-wrapped copy of \"I\" Is for Innocent while on lifeguard duty.\n\nParallels with author's life\nKinsey's prized Volkswagen Beetle, a mirror of the one author Sue Grafton owns in real life, is destroyed in this novel.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22I_AM%22_Activity?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The \"I AM\" Movement is the original Ascended Master Teachings religious movement founded in the early 1930s by Guy Ballard (1878–1939) and his wife Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard (1886–1971) in Chicago, Illinois. It is an offshoot of theosophy and a major precursor of several New Age religions including the Church Universal and Triumphant. The movement had up to a million followers in 1938 and is still active today on a smaller scale. According to the official website of the parent organization, the Saint Germain Foundation, its worldwide headquarters is located in Schaumburg, Illinois, and there are approximately 300 local groups worldwide under several variations of the names \"I AM\" Sanctuary, \"I AM\" Temple, and other similar titles. As of 2007, the organization states that its purpose is \"spiritual, educational and practical,\" and that no admission fee is charged for their activities. The term \"I AM\" is a reference to the ancient Sanskrit mantra \"So Ham\", meaning \"I Am that I Am\".\n\nOverview\nThe movement believes in the existence of a group called the Ascended Masters, a hierarchy of supernatural beings that includes the original Theosophical Masters such as Jesus Christ, El Morya Khan, Maitreya, and in addition several dozen more beyond the original 20 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom of the original Theosophists as described by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. These \"Ascended Masters\" are believed to be humans who have lived in a succession of reincarnations in physical bodies or cosmic beings (beings originated from the great central sun of light in the beginning of all times). Over time, those who have passed though various “embodiments” became highly advanced souls, are able to move beyond the cycles of \"re-embodiments\" and karma, and attained their \"Ascension\", becoming immortal. The Ascended Masters are believed to communicate to humanity through certain trained messengers per Blavatsky, including Guy and Edna Ballard. Because Jesus is believed to be one of the Ascended Masters, making the \"Christ Light\" available to seekers who wish to move out of darkness, many of the members of the \"I AM\" Activity consider it to be a Christian religion. According to the Los Angeles Magazine, Ballard said he was the re-embodiment of George Washington, an Egyptian priest, and a noted French musician. The \"I AM\" Activity was the continuation of the teachings received by H. P. Blavatsky and William Quan Judge. Ballard was always guided and inspired by the writings of William Quan Judge (1851-1896), who used the pseudonym David Lloyd due to the persecution of his enemies in the Theosophical Society. Then Ballard came in contact with the Mahatma called \"Ascended Master\" Saint Germain. Ballard died in 1939. In 1942 his wife and son were convicted of fraud, a conviction which was overturned in a landmark Supreme Court decision, ruling that the question of whether the Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to a jury. This event has been known as the determinant for the establishment of the policies regarding freedom of religion or beliefs rights in the United States of America.\n\nHistory\n\n\nFounding\nThe \"I AM\" Activity was founded by Guy Ballard (pseudonym Godfré Ray King) in the early 1930s. Ballard was well-read in theosophy and its offshoots, and while hiking on Mount Shasta looking for a rumored branch of the Great White Brotherhood known as \"The Brotherhood of Mount Shasta\", he claimed to have met and been instructed by a man who introduced himself as \"Saint Germain.\" Saint Germain is regular component of theosophical religions as an Ascended Master, based on the historical Comte de Saint-Germain, an 18th-century adventurer. The Ballards said they began talking to the Ascended Masters regularly. They founded a publishing house, Saint Germain Press, to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States. These training sessions and \"Conclaves\" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge. A front-page story in a 1938 edition of the Chicago Herald and Examiner noted that the Ballards \"do not take up collections or ask for funds\". Some of the original members of I AM were recruited from the ranks of William Dudley Pelley’s organization the Silver Shirts. Meetings became limited to members only after hecklers began disrupting their open meetings. Over their lifetimes, the Ballard's recorded nearly 4,000 Live dictations, which they said were from the Ascended Masters. Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and later his son Donald became the sole \"Accredited Messengers\" of the Ascended Masters.\n\nPopularity\nThe Ballards' popularity spread, including up to a million followers in 1938. They accepted donations (called \"love gifts\") from their followers across the country, though no such donation or dues were required. The first of many \"Conclaves\" held in scores of cities in their national tours was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 10–19, 1934. According to a Los Angeles Magazine article, in August 1935, the Ballards hosted a gathering at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles that drew a crowd of 6,000. Guy Ballard spoke under the pseudonym he used in authoring his books, Godfre Ray King, and his wife used the pseudonym Lotus. The meeting included teachings they described as being received directly from the Ascended Masters. They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.\n\nGuy Ballard's death\nAt the height of his popularity, Guy Ballard died from arteriosclerosis at 5:00 A.M. on December 29, 1939, in Los Angeles, in the home of his son Donald. On December 31 his body was cremated. On New Year's Day during the annual Christmas Class, Edna Ballard stated that Guy had completed his Ascension at midnight December 31, 1939, from the \"Royal Teton Retreat\". Students of the \"I Am\" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The \"I AM\" activity believe Ascension can mean Entering heaven alive, that is, to \"raise one's body\"—physically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the Ascension of Jesus. This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions. Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation. Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined \"Ascension\" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced \"51% of one's karma\". This modified and more practical definition of \"ascension\" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.\n\nCopyright infringement civil action\nIn 1941, the Ballards were sued for copyright infringement by the family and estate of Frederick Spencer Oliver (1866-1899), \"amenuensis\" of the novel A Dweller on Two Planets, first published in 1905. The suit was dismissed for failure to state cause of action. District Judge Dawkins quoted the original foreword to Oliver's book in its entirety, wherein Oliver emphasized that he was not the author but had channeled the book from the spirit of a previously deceased person with the intent of preserving and conveying the story and teachings of that person's world; and the book had been copyrighted with Oliver as a proprietor, not as the author. Judge Dawkins pointed out that the Ballards had stated they were using similar methods to write their books and that this in itself wasn't enough to uphold the action in court.\n\nFraud trial of Edna and Donald Ballard\nIn 1942, Edna Ballard and her son Donald were charged with eighteen counts of mail fraud on the basis of claims made in books sent through the mail. The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty. The Ninth Circuit overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the Supreme Court. In United States v. Ballard, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction. Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that \"the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court.\" On a second appeal, the Supreme Court in 1946 vacated the fraud conviction, on the grounds that women were improperly excluded from the jury panel.\n\nRelocation to Santa Fe and Edna Ballard's death\nIn March 1942, Edna Ballard moved the western branch of the Saint Germain Press and her residence to Santa Fe, where she recorded live before an audience thousands more dictations she said were from the Ascended Masters. Despite the ultimate dismissal of the court cases, it was not until 1954 that the organization's right to use the mail was restored. The Internal Revenue Service revoked their tax-exempt status in 1941, stating it did not recognize the movement as \"a religion\". A court ruling in 1957 overturned the ruling of the IRS and re-established the group's tax-exempt status.\n\nRecent history and present day\nAs of 2007, Saint Germain Foundation maintains a reading room in Mount Shasta, California, and its headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois. Several annual conclaves are held at their 12-story \"I AM Temple\" at 176 West Washington Street in downtown Chicago. Among the hundreds attending, there are usually dozens of \"I AM\" students from other nations. Classes and conclaves are regularly held in approximately 300 locations in America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. The Saint Germain Press, a subsidiary of the Saint Germain Foundation, publishes the historical books and related artwork and audio recordings of the Ballards' teachings, and a monthly magazine available by subscription, titled \"The Voice of the 'I AM'\". It has been estimated that the Saint Germain Press has printed and put into circulation over one million books. The Saint Germain Foundation presents the \"I AM\" COME! Pageant every August at Mount Shasta, and has done so each year since 1950. Their website states that the performance is open to the public at no cost, and describes the Pageant as a portrayal of \"the life of Beloved Jesus, focusing on His Miracles of Truth and Healing, and the example of the Ascension which He left to the world.\"\n\nTeachings\nAccording to the group's teachings, Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have left the reincarnation cycle of re-embodiment. The \"I AM\" Activity calls itself Christian, because Jesus is considered to be one of the more important Ascended Masters. It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master St. Germain is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same Masonic Lodge as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis. The movement teaches that the omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent creator God ('I AM' – Exodus 3:14) is in all of us as a spark from the Divine Flame, and that we can experience this presence, love, power and light – and its power of the Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love – through quiet contemplation and by repeating 'affirmations' and 'decrees'. By affirming something one desires, one may cause it to happen. The group teaches that the \"Mighty I AM Presence\" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the \"Violet Flame\" is generated by the \"I AM Presence\" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the \"Presence\" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life. The spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self-purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the \"I AM Presence\": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, invocations and affirmations; and external practices such as \"decrees\" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction), all of which are said to amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes.Members believe there is actual science behind decrees and affirmations and claim these practices are acknowledged by medicine as effective. The group also emphasizes personal freedom, embracing patriotic symbols, rendering honor to America giving the Pledge of Allegiance and the American’s Creed and always displaying American flags in its Temples or other offices. These \"positive thinking\" beliefs overlap with several other New Age movements such as Religious Science and the Human Potential Movement.\n\nSee also\n\n* Ascended master \n* Exaltation \n* Church Universal and Triumphant \n* Robert LeFevre \n* Mirra Alfassa \n* Supermind \n* Theosophy \n* I Am that I Am\n\nReferences\n\n\nPartial bibliography\n\n* Saint Germain Foundation.

They aim to clarify the words with which Jesus defines who he is in a variety of statements beginning with the words: \"I am\". The book thus aims to lead the reader to a better understanding of the mystery of Jesus Christ. These 31 meditations were originally published in 2001.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22I_Want%22_song?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The \"I Want\" song (also called an \"I Wish\" song) is a popular type of song featured in musical theatre, and has become a particularly popular term through its use to describe a series of songs featured in 1990s Disney animated features that had the main character singing about how they are unsatisfied with their current life, and what they are searching for. The term \"'I Want' song\" is believed to have been coined by Lehman Engel.\n\nPurpose\nComposer Stephen Schwartz explains the concept in regard to the 1995 Disney film Pocahontas: It's not really that there is a \"formula\" for these things, but I have learned over the years that pretty much any successful musical you can name has an \"I Want\" song for its main character within the first fifteen or so minutes of the show. I can think of exceptions, but frankly, I feel that the lack of such a moment is a weakness in most of those cases. \"Just Around the Riverbend\" may not be a classic \"I want\" song, because the character doesn't really want anything that strongly until she meets John Smith, but it sets up her sense that she has another destiny to pursue than the one laid out for her by her father and society and her desire to go after it. The third number, \"Mine Mine Mine\", was basically supposed to introduce the antagonist, Ratcliffe, and what he wanted, so that the central dramatic conflict could be established.\n\nPlacement within a musical\nMusical 101 explains: \"The Main \"I Want\" Song comes early in the first act, with one or more of the main characters singing about the key motivating desire that will propel everyone (including the audience) through the remainder of the show. It is often followed by a reprise. In many cases, these songs literally include the words \"I want\", \"I wish\" or \"I've got to\". Classic examples include My Fair Lady's \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\", Carnival's \"Mira\", The Sound of Music's \"I Have Confidence\", Wicked's \"The Wizard and I\", The Book of Mormon's \"You and Me (But Mostly Me)\", Hamilton's \"My Shot\", and The Producers' \"King of Broadway\". Bob Fosse said there were only three types of show songs from a director's point of view: \"I Am\" songs – a song that explains a character/situation, \"I Want\" songs – desire/motivations, and New songs – A song that doesn't fit the other categories.\n\nBeyond a musical\nSchwartz also notes \"I Want\" songs are usually those which have a life beyond the music they were featured in: I don't think it's surprising that \"I Want\" songs tend to be among the most recorded -- they are often somewhat more liftable than other songs in the show (that is, they make sense outside the framework of the show) and they give the singer something to act. In classic terms, the job of an \"I Want\" song is not to move the action forward, but to set up the desire of the leading character that will drive the action for the rest of the show.\n\nHistorical composition\nSchwartz has also written \"I Want\" songs for live action musicals, including \"Corner of the Sky\" for Pippin and \"The Wizard and I\" for Wicked.\n\nDisney\nThe Walt Disney Company has a long tradition of \"I Want\" songs in Disney animated musicals going back to the Disney Renaissance era. The term has retroactively been used to describe older \"I Want\" songs. In a top ten list of Disney, The Daily Dot ranked Robin Hood's \"Not in Nottingham\" as the best \"I Want\" song. The site also noted that these could be sung by antagonists, ranking The Hunchback of Notre Dame's \"Hellfire\" at number 5. FanPop listed \"Part of Your World\" from The Little Mermaid as the best song of this type. The WFPL article Great 'I Want' Moments in Musicals listed \"Belle\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\", \"Lonely Room\", \"Corner of the Sky\", and \"Part of Your World\".\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"'I Want' Song\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22I_quit%22_match?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "An \"I quit\" match is a type of professional wrestling match in which the only way to win is to make the opponent say the words \"I quit\" (usually into a microphone). It is a variation of submission match as it can only be won by submission, but it is special in that the submission has to take the form of the forfeiting opponent saying \"I quit\". Generally, whenever a wrestler knocks down their opponent with a move or inflicts a submission move, the opponent will be asked—either by the referee or the opponent—to say the words into a microphone. \"I quit\" matches are commonly used to settle kayfabe grudges and embarrass rivals since saying \"I quit\" is usually a sign of admitted inferiority.\n\nHistory\nThe first \"I quit\" match was in the National Wrestling Alliance/Jim Crockett Promotions at Starrcade on November 28, 1985. Magnum T. A. defeated Tully Blanchard in a match (with a cage around the ring) for Blanchard's NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Near the end of that match, Magnum used a piece of wood with a nail in it to pierce Blanchard's forehead. At that point, Blanchard screamed \"Yes! Yes!\" into the microphone, indicating that he was quitting the match and Magnum won the championship. One of the most famous \"I quit\" matches took place on January 24, 1999 at the Royal Rumble between The Rock and Mick Foley (as Mankind) in the World Wrestling Federation. The match lasted just over 20 minutes, ending after Foley took eleven unprotected chair shots to the head while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. The Rock eventually won the match, but it was later revealed that Foley was completely unconscious and The Rock had played a tape of Foley saying \"I quit\" over the public address system. The following night on Raw, The Rock's \"I quit!\" match against Triple H ended when Triple H was extorted into saying \"I quit\" because Kane was about to chokeslam Chyna. John Cena retained his WWE Championship by defeating John Bradshaw Layfield in an \"I quit\" match at Judgment Day on May 22, 2005. At Breaking Point on September 13, 2009, Cena defeated his long time rival Randy Orton in an \"I quit\" match, forcing Orton to say \"I quit\" while he was handcuffed and Cena simultaneously had applied his submission hold, the STF. \"I quit\" matches involving women have been rare. At No Mercy on October 19, 2003, there was an intergender match between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and his daughter Stephanie partly under \"I quit\" rules. However, the match was decided when Stephanie's mother Linda threw in the towel for her daughter, giving Vince the victory. The first \"I quit\" match between WWE Divas was contested at One Night Stand on June 1, 2008, when Beth Phoenix defeated Melina. On the May 14, 2009 episode of Impact, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), now known as Impact Wrestling, put on its first \"I quit\" match, where Booker T defeated Jethro Holiday after an axe kick. TNA had another \"I quit\" match on May 24, 2009, where A.J. Styles defeated Booker T to retain the TNA Legends Championship after Jenna Morasca threw a towel into the ring for Booker T. On the May 4, 2016 episode of Lucha Underground, Sexy Star defeated Mariposa in the promotion's first \"I quit\" match, known in Spanish as a \"no mas\" (\"no more\") match. An \"I respect you\" match is a variation of the \"I quit\" match as to win a wrestler must make their opponent say the words \"I respect you\". The first \"I respect you\" match was held in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at SuperBrawl VI on February 11, 1996 and pitted Brian Pillman and Kevin Sullivan. At the end of the match, Pillman lost by saying \"I respect you, bookerman!\". In doing so, Pillman broke kayfabe as Sullivan was also WCW booker at the time. One January 17, 2017 episode of WWE 205 Live, Gentleman Jack Gallagher defeated Ariya Daivari in a variation of the \"I quit\" match called the \"I forfeit\" match by forcing Daivari to say \"I forfeit\".\n\nMatches\n\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling\n\n\nLucha Underground\nIn the promotion, \"I quit\" matches are billed as a \"No Más Match,\" with the submission phrase was made in Spanish (\"No más\").\n\nRing of Honor\n\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling\n\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling\n\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation/Entertainment\n\n\nReferences\n" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Irish%22_Teddy_Mann?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Irish\" Teddy Mann (born September 5, 1951) is the professional nickname of former world-rated middleweight boxing pro, Theodore A. Mannschreck, also known as Ted \"The Irish\" Man. Born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, he moved to the Forked River section of Lacey Township, New Jersey while very young, and it was there that he first developed his lifelong love for the sport of boxing. As an amateur, Ted amassed an impressive record and fought some tough competitors including A.A.U. Champion, Curtis Parker and several golden gloves champs. While attending Central Regional High School, in Forked River, he broke more than one track and cross county school record and was captain of the cross country team. After turning pro on August 24, 1977, Mannschreck shortened his name to \"Mann\" at the suggestion of his manager, Carmen Graziano. Early on in his career his prospects looked very promising and going into his contest with \"Bad\" Bennie Briscoe, in 1979, at the Philadelphia Spectrum, he had garnered a record of 18-1. That fight proved to be the turning point of his career as it resulted in Mann sustaining an injury to his right hand from which he never fully recovered. Several years later, he managed to defeat world-rated contender, Robbie Epps to earn a ranking of seventh in the world from Ring Magazine and eighth in the world, from the WBA.\n\nReferences\n" .

Due to Tacitus's usage of interpretatio romana elsewhere in the text, his admitted uncertainty, and his reasoning for referring to the veneration of an Egyptian goddess by the Suebi—a group of Germanic peoples—scholars have generally held that Tacitus's identification is incorrect, and have debated what goddess Tacitus refers to.\n\nAttestation\nIn chapter 9 of Germania, Tacitus, employing interpretatio romana (a process in which what an author deems Roman equivalents are listed in place of non-Roman deity names), says that the Suebi principally venerate \"Mercury\", and that they regard it as sacral to offer him both human and non-human sacrifices on specific dates (unprovided). The Suebi also worship \"Mars\" and \"Hercules\", who they appease by offering animals in a traditional manner. Tacitus adds that a part of the Suebi, however, venerate \"Isis\", although he admits that he doesn't know how worship of Isis could have been imported:\n\nTheories and interpretations\nWhile Tacitus's \"Mercury\", \"Mars\", and \"Hercules\" are generally held to refer to Odin, Tyr, and Thor respectively, the identity of \"Isis\" has been a matter of debate. In his translation of Germania, scholar J. B. Rives comments that while, in Tacitus's time, the cult of Isis was widespread and is well attested in provinces on the border of Germania, Tacitus's identification is problematic because the cult of Isis seems to have spread with Greco-Roman culture. Rives comments that \"most scholars believe that Tacitus has misidentified a native Germanic ritual that bore some resemblance to a well-known Isiac ritual that involved a ship [...]\". In a 2012 paper, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson propose a connection between a Vanir goddess, particularly Freyja, and the ship symbolism of the \"Isis\" of the Suebi. The two propose that Old Norse texts mentioning Fólkvangr and Sessrúmnir present an image of a 'ship in the field', implying a strong association between Freyja and ship imagery, particularly the stone ships of Scandinavia.\n\nSee also\n\n* Nerthus, another Germanic goddess mentioned by Tacitus in his Germania \n* Baduhenna, a Germanic goddess mentioned by Tacitus in his Annals \n* Tamfana, another Germanic goddess mentioned by Tacitus in his Annals\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Birley, A.

The novel is set in 1984 and features a significant development in Kinsey's personal back-story, as she discovers that she has extensive family living in the Lompoc area.\n\nPlot summary\nJuly 1984 contains two surprises for Kinsey Millhone, both connected to her past. First, California Fidelity Insurance reappears in her life in the form of Mac Voorhies, who wants her help with a case some seven months after his boss Gordon Titus terminated Kinsey's loose employment relationship with CFI. Secondly, in the course of the investigation, Kinsey makes a shocking discovery about her own past when she learns she has a family about which she previously knew nothing. The case Mac hires Kinsey to investigate is that of Wendell Jaffe, assumed to have died five years previously when his boat, the Captain Stanley Lord, was found drifting off the Baja coast. He left behind a suicide note, a number of creditors who had invested in what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, and a family: a wife, Dana, along with sons Michael and Brian. It seemed certain Jaffe had killed himself to avoid the disgrace and jail sentence, which fell instead to his business partner, Carl Eckert. But with no body to prove death, CFI made Dana wait the full statutory five years to presume death before paying out on Jaffe's half-million insurance claim; and she has been making ends meet by working as a wedding planner. Michael, now 22, has coped reasonably well with suddenly being the man of the house and is a new husband and father himself. Eighteen-year-old Brian, on the other hand, is in a mess, currently residing in juvenile hall. Two months after the insurance money was finally paid, a former colleague of Mac's has spotted a man he is convinced is Jaffe in Viento Negro, Mexico. Mac hires Kinsey to go there and check it out. After a little hotel room breaking and entering, she finds Wendell is now known as Dean DeWitt Huff, travelling with a woman called Renata Huff, who has a residence on the quays in Perdido, near Santa Teresa, as well as a boat of her own. Before Kinsey can prove his identity, they skip out; on the same day, Brian is arrested in the middle of a botched escape attempt in which a female motorist, as well as his three conspirators, are killed. Kinsey is convinced Wendell will be heading back to California to reconnect with his son. Doing a door-to-door back in California, Kinsey is astonished to be asked if she is related to the Burton Kinsey family of Lompoc, as she looks so like them. Kinsey denies the connection but undertakes a little detective work on her behalf and is amazed to find her mother's father was indeed Burton Kinsey. Far from being family-less, Kinsey has cousins, aunts and a grandmother living less than an hour away. Her cousin Liza shows up to tell her the family scandal: Kinsey's mother was cut off from her family for marrying Kinsey's father. Kinsey is aghast that no one has tried to track her down in the 29 years since her parents were killed and is resentful of any intrusion into her solitude at this late date. Her thoughts are dragged back to the case at hand when through an apparent police clerical error, Brian is suddenly released from prison. Kinsey is certain Wendell has engineered it and is planning to slip through her fingers again with Brian. Renata catches Kinsey red-handed searching on her property but when Kinsey turns the tables (and her own gun) on her, Renata admits Wendell is visiting Michael. At last, Kinsey has tracked Jaffe down, but her success is short lived when someone takes potshots at them both and Wendell escapes once more. The day after, the Captain Stanley Lord, where Eckert has been living for the past few years, also goes missing while Eckert is away; and when it's found drifting uninhabited a few miles off-shore, there's a distinct sense of deja-vu about Wendell's disappearance. Nevertheless, it's enough for CFI: Kinsey has proved Jaffe didn't die and therefore the insurance money can be reclaimed from Dana. But Kinsey is dissatisfied—she wants the truth and is prepared to pursue it on her own time. She finds Brian, and also finds out from Eckert that there was three million dollars from their fraudulent business scheme on board the missing boat. Renata confesses that she killed Wendell, dumped his body at sea, and then set the Lord adrift, making her way back to shore in her own dinghy. She then wades out into the sea to kill herself, and Kinsey is unable to stop her. Renata's story is apparently confirmed when Jaffe's body washes up on the shore. But Renata's never does, leaving Kinsey wondering if she has managed to fake her own death just like Wendell.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator who is asked to again work for the insurance company that severed ties months earlier.\n\nReception\n\"J\" Is for Judgment was a New York Times best-seller and had an initial press run of nearly half a million copies.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22K%22_Is_for_Killer?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"K\" Is for Killer is the 11th novel in Sue Grafton's \"Alphabet\" series of mystery novels and features Kinsey Millhone, a private eye based in Santa Teresa, California. The novel was a New York Times bestseller with a reported 600,000-copy first printing. Vice cop Cheney Phillips is introduced in this novel.\n\nPlot\nKinsey Millhone is hired by Janice Kepler to investigate the death of her daughter, Lorna Kepler. Lorna had been found dead and badly decomposed ten months earlier in her lonely cabin home. The police at the time suspected it might have been a murder case, but from lack of evidence as to cause of death, the official line was that Lorna died naturally, as a result of an allergic reaction. Now someone has sent Janice a tape of a porn movie Lorna apparently made before her death, and Janice, who has coped badly with her daughter's death, wants Kinsey to find out the truth. Mace, Janice's husband, and her two surviving daughters, Berlyn and Trinny, seem less keen on the investigation, and Mace and Berlyn, in particular, become positively hostile to Kinsey as she sets out to find out what happened to Lorna. With some help from Officer Cheney Phillips, Kinsey quickly learns that Lorna, who was a receptionist at the water treatment plant by day, had accumulated a modest fortune as a high class prostitute by night. Lorna was a beautiful loner, but had some friends - mainly people who like her tended to be up and about at night. Kinsey finds herself having to abandon her usual day-time routine in order to get herself into Lorna's world. Lorna's body was found by Serena Bonney, night-shift nurse and estranged wife of Lorna's boss at the water treatment plant, Roger Bonney. Serena's father, Clark Esselmann, is a powerful business tycoon with a number of enemies. She also befriends Danielle, a teenage colleague of Lorna's in her night-time occupation, who obliges Kinsey by giving her a badly needed haircut. When Danielle is savagely attacked in her home, Kinsey becomes convinced there's a link to Lorna's death, and her quest to discover the truth becomes more personal. Meanwhile, Kinsey has a terrifying Mafia-style encounter with a man describing himself as an attorney for a Los Angeles man to whom Lorna was engaged. He asks Kinsey to keep him abreast of any developments in the case by giving her a telephone number. Kinsey soon uncovers a variety of secrets: Berlyn actually discovered Lorna's body, but kept quiet about in order to lift some of Lorna's money, and also sent her mother the porn video. Leda had bugged Lorna's cabin because she was worried (needlessly, as it turned out) that Lorna and JD were having an affair - and still has the tape. With the help of Lorna's friend, late-night radio DJ Hector Mereno, Kinsey transcribes a phone conversation Lorna had before her death which seems to have upset Lorna, but she can't make sense of it until Clark Esselmann is electrocuted in his swimming pool. Kinsey realizes that the conversation on the tape is someone telling Lorna the plot - and surmises that having objected to it, Lorna was killed so that the plot could still be carried out. Her suspicions turn to Stubby Stockton, a business opponent of Esselmann's, and to Roger Bonney, since Kinsey now knows, from Berlyn's admission of the discovery of the body, that Lorna was already dead when Roger claimed he spoke to her for the last time. He is also the one with the necessary knowledge and access to his father-in-law's pool to have set up the electrocution. The final link in the chain is when Kinsey, in the course of cleaning up Danielle's trashed apartment while she's still in hospital, finds a photo of Lorna and Danielle with Stockton and Bonney. Kinsey talks to Cheney about her suspicions of Roger, but he points out there is no evidence. Frustrated that Bonney is likely to get away with murder, Kinsey is further infuriated by learning that Danielle has died in hospital. Impulsively, she phones the secret number and reports that Bonney is the killer. Overcome with guilt, she immediately tries to warn him, but he misunderstands, thinking she has come to confront him with the murder, and stuns her with a tazer. While Kinsey lies powerless on the floor, the Mafia types arrive and escort Bonney away. In the epilogue, Kinsey discusses the enormity of what she has done, disclosing that Roger Bonney was never seen again. She ends on an existential note, wondering if she can return from the \"shadows\" she has strayed into.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator\n\nDevelopment of the story\nIt was originally going to be titled \"K\" Is for Kidnap, until Sue Grafton's initial research revealed that kidnapping was a federal crime and realized that the FBI would never consult a small-time private investigator like Kinsey Millhone.\n\nReviews\n\n\nAwards\n\"K\" Is for Killer was awarded the 1995 Shamus Award for Best Novel from the Private Eye Writers of America and was nominated for the 1995 Anthony Award in the same category.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

While not of royal descent, he was eventually nicknamed \"King\" as many show business personalities are for their particular genre. Nawahi learned to play guitar in the parks of Honolulu for pennies, often teaming with Sol Hoʻopiʻi, who would later become his rival for the title \"King of the Hawaiian Guitar\", along with Sam Ku West. He was also known as \"King of the Ukulele\". In 1919 Nawahi played with his brother Joe's band, the Hawaiian Novelty Five, on the Matsonia passenger liner that sailed between Honolulu and San Francisco. The group eventually became a staple on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit's North America tour. Bennie Nawahi separated from the group and embarked on a solo career as a singing ukulele player. Master showman Sid Grauman proclaimed him \"King of the Ukulele\" and the nickname stuck. In 1920 an act of the United States Congress established \"Hawaii National Park\" (later split into Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and Haleakalā National Park), shining a spotlight on the islands. The 1920s became a heydey for all things Hawaiian, including novelty acts of the vaudeville genre. Among Nawahi's novelty stunts was playing Turkey in the Straw on Hawaiian guitar with his feet. Tin Pan Alley went with the Hawaii craze and between 1915 and 1929 produced such ditties as Hello Hawaii How Are You? (1915) (when many pronounced the state's name as How-Wah-Yah), Oh How She Could Yacki Hacki Wiki Wacki Woo (1916), Hula Hula Dream Girl (1924) and That Aloha Waltz (1928). There is some evidence Bennie Nawahi also used the name \"J. Nawahi\", as the Victor Library lists the tune Hula Blues by \"J. Nawahi (instrumentalist : steel guitar)\". By 1928 Nawahi had begun recording for multiple record labels, including Columbia, Victor, Q.R.S. and Grey Gull, under multiple names (including Red Devils, Q.R.S. Boys, Slim Smith, Hawaiian Beach Combers, Georgia Jumpers, Four Hawaiian Guitars and King Nawahi & the International Cowboys), with bandmates that included soon to be Sons of the Pioneers, Tim Spencer (singer) and Leonard Slye (later to become cowboy star Roy Rogers).\n\nBlindness and later life\nOne night in 1935 while driving home from a performance, Nawahi was suddenly struck blind. No medical cause was ever identified. The loss of vision was permanent, but he never allowed it to impede his life, as he continued performing and touring until the 1970s, when he was partially paralyzed by a stroke. Nawahi set a remarkable swimming record for blind people in 1946. He swam the 22 miles of choppy Pacific Ocean waters from San Pedro, California to Santa Catalina Island in just over 22 hours, guided only by coach John Sonnichson and a bell on a lead boat. He appeared briefly in the 1985 Academy Award-nominated documentary film on Roy Smeck, Wizard of the Strings. He died in Long Beach, California on January 29, 1985.\n\nDiscography\n\n* From Honolulu To Hollywood: Jazz, Blues & Popular Specialties Performed Hawaiian Style (2008) CD (The Old Masters) \n* Hawaiian String Virtuoso: Steel Guitar Rec 1920's (2000) CD 2055 (Yazoo)\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Nawahi, Victor Library" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Left-Wing%22_Communism:_An_Infantile_Disorder?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder (Russian: Детская болезнь \"левизны\" в коммунизме, Detskaya Bolezn' \"Levizny\" v Kommunizme) is a work by Vladimir Lenin attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left. Most of these critics were proponents of ideologies later described as left communism. The book was written in 1920 and published in Russian, German, English and French later in the year. A copy was then distributed to each delegate at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, several of whom were mentioned by Lenin in the work. The book is divided into ten chapters and an appendix. Lenin's manuscript was subtitled \"A Popular Exposition of Marxist Strategy and Tactics\", but this was not applied to any edition brought out during his lifetime.\n\nBolsheviks\nLenin points out that the Russian Revolution has considerable international significance and criticises the leaders of the Second International, including Karl Kautsky, for failing to recognize the international relevance of soviet power as a revolutionary model. To illustrate their move away from revolutionary politics, he supplies a quote from a 1902 work of Kautsky which concludes that \"Western Europe is becoming a bulwark of reaction and absolutism in Russia\". Lenin asserts that in a war against the bourgeoisie \"iron discipline\" is an \"essential condition\". He then describes the circumstances which led the Bolsheviks to this conclusion in their success at taking state power in Russia. The third chapter divides the history of Bolshevism into the \"years of preparation of the revolution\" (1903–1905), the \"years of revolution\" (1905–1907), the \"years of reaction\" (1907–1910), the \"years of rise\" (1910–1914), the \"first imperialist world war\" (1914–1917) and the \"second revolution in Russia\". He describes the changing circumstances for revolutionaries in Russia and the reaction of the Bolsheviks to them. Lenin describes the enemies of the working class as opportunists, petty-bourgeois revolutionaries which he links to anarchism; and the \"Left\" Bolsheviks (expelled from the Bolshevik group in 1909), whom he links with those who criticised the Peace of Brest-Litovsk. He ends by criticizing the Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries and members of the Socialist International who were prepared to compromise with the German leaders in defence of a capitalist system.\n\n\"Left-wing\" communism in Germany\nThe fifth, sixth and seventh chapters discuss a section of the Communist Party of Germany which split between the writing of the document and its publication to form the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). As an example, he takes Karl Erler's article \"The Dissolution of the Party\". Lenin criticised the group's anti-trade union attitude, their anti-parliamentarism and Erler's proposal of a dictatorship of the masses as a counterpoint to the \"dictatorship of the party\" he claims the Russian Revolution has led to. Lenin notes that the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) rely on the Russian trade unions and that a reactionary labour aristocracy is inevitable, but must be fought within the union movement. In contrast to the KAPD, he holds that so long as much of the proletariat holds illusions in parliaments, communists must work inside such reactionary organisations. Lenin then compares the anti-parliamentarism of the Dutch left and that of Amadeo Bordiga. Lenin then criticises the slogan \"no compromises\", noting that the Bolsheviks had made many compromises in their history. He believes that this is using theory as dogma, rather than as a \"guide to action\". Lenin also criticises National Bolshevism and some leftists for not recognising the Treaty of Versailles.\n\n\"Left-wing\" communism in Great Britain\nLenin critiques the Workers Socialist Federation's opposition to parliamentary action and in particular to affiliation to the Labour Party through texts written by Sylvia Pankhurst and Willie Gallacher. He proposes that all the main socialist groups in the country should form a Communist Party of Great Britain and that they should offer an electoral coalition with Labour. He concludes that the party would gain whether or not Labour accepted the offer. In a famous turn of phrase, he says that they should support Labour General Secretary Arthur Henderson \"in the same way as the rope supports a hanged man\".\n\nLenin's conclusions\nLenin concludes that in each country, communism must struggle against Menshevism and \"Left-Wing\" communism. He claims that communism has already won over the vanguard of the workers, but that to win over the masses it must relate to the differences between the Hendersons, the Lloyd Georges (liberals) and the Churchills (conservatives). Despite certain defeats, he believes that the communist movement is \"developing magnificently\". Lenin describes \"Left-Wing\" communism as the same mistake as that of the social democrats, but \"the other way round\", one that must be corrected; and that because \"Left-Wing\" communism is only a young trend, it is \"at present a thousand times less dangerous and less significant than the mistakes of Right doctrinairism\".\n\nResponses to the work\nSeveral appendices were added to the document before publication in response to new developments in Germany around the formation of the KAPD and new studies by Lenin of the Italian left. A final appendix acknowledged a letter on behalf of the Communist Party of Holland in which David Wijnkoop complained that the positions Lenin accorded to their organisation were only those of a minority in the group. Lenin invited Pankhurst and Gallagher to the Second Conference of the Comintern. He convinced them to argue for their party, by then renamed the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International), to join the Communist Party of Great Britain. The CP(BSTI) did join and Gallagher remained a loyal member, although Pankhurst was expelled from the CPGB in 1921 and subsequently allied her remaining group with the KAPD, supporting the Communist Workers' International. Herman Gorter replied to Lenin in an open letter, arguing that the smaller numbers of peasants in Western Europe constituted a key difference to the class struggle to that in Russia. In the introduction, he stated: It has taught me a great deal, as all your writings have done. [...] Many a trace, and many a germ of this infantile disease, to which without a doubt, I also am a victim, has been chased away by your brochure, or will yet be eradicated by it. Your observations about the confusion that revolution has caused in many brains, is quite right too. I know that. The revolution came so suddenly, and in a way so utterly different from what we expected. Your words will be an incentive to me, once again, and to an even greater extent than before, to base my judgement in all matters of tactics, also in the revolution, exclusively on reality, on the actual class-relations, as they manifest themselves politically and economically. After having read your brochure I thought all this is right. But after having considered for a long time whether I would cease to uphold this \"Left Wing\", and to write articles for the KAPD and the Opposition party in England, I had to decline.\n\nReferences\n\n\nLiterature\n\n* Broué P.

It is a critically endangered species of frog that is endemic to southeastern Australia. Its natural habitats are temperate grassland, rivers, intermittent rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and ponds.\n\nEcology\n\"Litoria castanea\" is a member of the Litoria aurea complex, being distinguished by cream markings on its thighs. The overall colour is pale green and the dark to black spots are highlighted by the bronze patches. The toes are entirely webbed, the species favouring permanent water bodies. The reasons behind its drastic decline are unclear, but the disease chytridiomycosis is suspected to have played a major role. No recorded sighting had been made since 1980, and the species was believed to be extinct. However, in late 2009 New South Wales Fisheries field scientist Luke Pearce located a surviving population of the frogs. Scientists acted quickly to establish a small \"insurance\" colony. Soon after, the wild colony was eradicated due to two consecutive floods and an outbreak of chytrid fungus. Following a breeding program at Sydney's Taronga Zoo, in early 2018 a colony of yellow-spotted bell frogs were released in a secret location in the New South Wales southern tablelands.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nData related to \"Litoria\" castanea at Wikispecies \n* \"Litoria castanea\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Little%22_North_Western_Railway?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "The North Western Railway (NWR) was an early British railway company in the north-west of England. It was commonly known as the \"Little\" North Western Railway, to distinguish it from the larger London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The NWR was first leased, and later taken over, by the Midland Railway (MR). The MR used part of the line for its London to Scotland Settle and Carlisle main line. The NWR main line, which ran from Skipton in the West Riding of Yorkshire to Morecambe on the Lancashire coast, gave the MR access to the west coast in an area dominated by the rival LNWR. Part of the line, between Lancaster and Morecambe, was used in the early twentieth century for pioneering overhead electrification. Two-thirds of the line, in North Yorkshire, is still in use today, mainly for local services. Of the dismantled Lancashire section, two-thirds has been reused as a combined cyclepath and footpath.\n\nFormation\nThe North Western Railway was incorporated on 26 June 1846 to build a railway from Skipton on the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway to  on the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, to carry Yorkshire-to-Scotland rail traffic. There would be a branch at Clapham, Yorkshire to Lancaster, to make an end-on connection with an associated company.\n\nMorecambe Harbour and Railway\nThe Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company was incorporated on 16 July 1846 to build a harbour on Morecambe Bay, close to the village of Poulton-le-Sands, and 3 miles (5 km) of railway to a new station at Lancaster Green Ayre. The single-track line opened on Whit Monday 12 June 1848. On 18 December 1849 a short connecting curve opened between Lancaster Green Ayre and Lancaster Castle on the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway. The company amalgamated with the NWR within months of its incorporation, although technically it remained a separate company until absorption by the Midland Railway on 1 June 1871. The railway and harbour on Morecambe Bay led to the development of a settlement around them which absorbed Poulton-le-Sands, and later Bare and Torrisholme, and which eventually adopted the name of Morecambe.\n\nConstruction\nWhat was the original 'main line' opened between Skipton and Ingleton, on 31 July 1849. However, due to economic recession, work on the Ingleton-to-Low Gill section was suspended, so the NWR was forced to concentrate on the branch to Lancaster. Soon after, the line eastwards along the Lune valley from Lancaster Green Ayre to Wennington opened on 17 November 1849. The line extended further east to Bentham by 2 May 1850 and finally to Clapham where it joined the already completed line from Skipton, a month later on 1 June 1850. A horse bus had been used to bridge the gap between Wennington and Clapham during construction. Upon completion of the Morecambe-to-Skipton line, the Clapham-to-Ingleton section was closed, just ten months after opening, as the prospect of completion of the partly built branch to Low Gill seemed remote. The whole line was originally single track. By 1850, the -to-Hellifield section had been doubled, extending to Skipton by 1853. However, Morecambe-to-Lancaster remained single track until 1877, and Lancaster-to-Hornby until 1889. The curve between the two Lancaster stations was never doubled. From 1 June 1852, the NWR was worked by the Midland Railway (MR). Later, on 1 January 1859, both the NWR and the MH&R were leased to the MR, and on 30 July 1874 the NWR was absorbed by the MR.\n\nConnecting lines\n\n\nThe Ingleton Branch\n(Main article: Ingleton Branch Line)\nAfter considerable manoeuvring between rival companies, in 1857 it was the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, worked by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), that was authorised to take over construction of the abandoned Ingleton-to-Low Gill line. The line opened to passengers on 16 September 1861, but to the LNWR's own station at Ingleton. The Midland and LNWR stations were at opposite ends of a viaduct, and passengers had to walk between them. However, by 1862 the LNWR trains ran through to the Midland station.\n\nThe Settle-Carlisle Line\n(Main article: Settle-Carlisle Line)\nDue to continuing friction between the MR and the LNWR over the Ingleton Branch, the MR resolved to build its own line from Settle to Carlisle, which opened to passengers on 1 May 1876. This line formed part of the MR's main line from London St Pancras to Carlisle Citadel and on to Glasgow St Enoch via the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Thus the NWR line between Skipton and Settle Junction gained main line status. Even today, the line is occasionally used for inter-city diversions.\n\nOther connecting lines\nThe Furness and Midland Joint Railway built a line from Wennington on the NWR to Carnforth, where there was already a junction between the Furness Railway and the LNWR's Lancaster and Carlisle Railway. The line opened to passengers on 6 June 1867. The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway also built a branch from Hest Bank on its main line to meet the NWR just before , opening on 13 August 1864. However, LNWR passenger trains had their own station, initially at  and, from 1886, at Morecambe Euston Road. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway extended its line through Clitheroe to a junction with the NWR at Hellifield on 1 June 1880.\n\nExtension to Heysham\nHeysham Harbour was opened by the Midland Railway in 1904, to replace the same company's harbour in Morecambe. A branch line from the NWR line had already opened for contractors on 12 November 1898 but was opened to passengers on 1 September 1904. The new line made a triangular junction with the existing NWR line a very short distance east of the junction with the LNWR line from Hest Bank.\n\nElectrification\n(Further information: MR electric units)\nThe line between Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham pioneered the use of overhead cables for electrification. Heysham-to-Morecambe was electrified on 13 April 1908, extending to Lancaster Green Ayre on 1 July and to Lancaster Castle on 14 September. The system used 6.6 kV at 25 Hz, with the electricity provided by a power station at Heysham, supplied via cables suspended from overhead steel archways. After 11 February 1951, steam trains temporarily took over while the system was upgraded to 6.6 kV at 50 Hz. Full electric service resumed on 17 August 1953. Power was supplied from a new substation at Green Ayre. On a 4,000-foot (1,200 m) section of track, the overhead arches were replaced by experimental cantilever structures, separate for each of the two tracks.\n\nClosures\nThe Ingleton Branch closed to passengers on 30 January 1954, but was still used for goods and occasional excursions until closure on 26 July 1966, after which the tracks were lifted. The Wennington-to-Morecambe section of the line was closed under the Beeching Axe. Passenger traffic ceased on 2 January 1966. However, an alternative Wennington-to-Morecambe connection has been maintained using the former Furness and Midland Joint Railway to Carnforth and thence the former LNWR Morecambe Branch Line, a route still in use today by the Leeds to Morecambe Line. Goods traffic via the Lune Valley line ceased on 4 June 1967, except for a short single-track spur from the Heysham line towards Lancaster which closed on 31 January 1970, and another single-track spur from Lancaster Castle to a power station which closed on 16 March 1976. Almost all of the route of the dismantled line between Caton and Morecambe has been preserved as a combined cyclepath and footpath, except for a short section near Lancaster city centre. Here the line's Greyhound Bridge over the River Lune was converted for use as a road bridge. The Morecambe-to-Heysham branch closed to passengers on 4 October 1975, but reopened on 11 May 1987 for sailings to the Isle of Man. The branch has been single track since Morecambe station was relocated in 1994. The branch now connects only to platform 2.\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n* Anon.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Lockkeeper's%22_House?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Lockkeeper's\" House is a historic building located south of Eldon along the Des Moines River in Davis County, Iowa, United States. More specifically it is located in Section 1 of Salt Creek Township. Local legend associates this stone house with the Des Moines River Improvement Project, which was conceived to build a lock and dam system along the Des Moines River to make it navigable from the Mississippi River to the Raccoon River at Des Moines. Historically, the resource was situated at this location for access and control over the river locks proposed to be built at Eldon. With the failure of the Des Moines River Navigation Company the project failed in the early 1841’s. Built in 1845 the Lockkeeper’s House consists of a 1 ¾ story, end gabled, solid masonry building. The building served only as a residence having never been used for the locks, which were never built. It has a two-over-two room plan and a masonry central dividing wall with a built in chimney.

The novel is set in 1986.\n\nPlot summary\nIn January 1986, Tasha Howard hires her cousin Kinsey Millhone to find an heir of the wealthy Malek family. When patriarch Bader Malek died, everyone assumed his $40 million estate would be split between his sons: Donovan, who runs the Malek construction empire; Bennet, a would-be entrepreneur; and Jack, a playboy. However, the will also names the supposedly disinherited second son Guy, the black sheep of the family who left home 18 years ago and whom the family has not seen or heard from since. His unlikeable brothers do not want him back in their lives, nor do they want his taking a cut of the inherited millions. Kinsey sympathizes with the story of Guy's exile from his family, as she struggles to deal with her own family troubles. With illicit help from Darcy Pascoe, a friend at California Fidelity Insurance, Kinsey tracks Guy to the small town of Marcella near Santa Teresa. After being rescued by local pastor Peter Antle and his wife Winnie, Guy has become a devout Christian and turned his life around. Kinsey finds him the nicest of the Malek brothers. Despite Kinsey's warnings, Guy agrees to return to his childhood home. Ugly family scenes ensue. Kinsey's worst fears for Guy are exceeded when he is found brutally bludgeoned to death at the family home. Feeling guilty for his death, Kinsey tries to find his killer. At the same time, Kinsey deals with her own personal problems, including the reappearance of Robert Dietz, a private investigator ex. We also learn that Kinsey's ex-boyfriend Jonah Robb, the investigating officer on Guy's death, is back with his wife Camilla, while also pursuing a fling with a police colleague. Eventually, Kinsey and Dietz resume their relationship, albeit on a transient basis; and Dietz helps her with the case. Initial physical evidence implicates Jack Malek in Guy's murder; and his attorney, Lonnie Kingman, hires Kinsey to investigate further for Jack's defense. Kinsey believes the crime's motive lies in the past but can't reconcile Guy's misdemeanors with the character of the man she knew. She decides Guy was a scapegoat for crimes he didn't commit: for example, Guy supposedly swindled widow Mrs. Maddison out of a fortune in valuable historical documents, alongside getting daughter Patti pregnant. Kinsey discovers that Bennet and his university friend Paul Trasatti completed the crime under the name Maxwell Outhwaite, a pseudonym constructed from two adjacent books, after the fashion of Conan Edogawa. She also connects the name to the murder to the Maddison family; but since Patty Maddison's mother, her sister Claire, and other family have died, this appears to be a frustrating dead end. Dietz discovers that the story of Claire's death has been faked. Meanwhile, Enid reports that Myrna has disappeared from the Malek home in circumstances suggestive of foul play. Kinsey realizes that Myrna is actually Claire, having bided her time to get revenge on the Malek family and Guy in particular. Claire tries to escape on foot; but Kinsey catches her and confronts her with her crime against Guy, the blameless brother. After confessing to destroying the will that disinherited Guy and confessing to the murder itself, Claire commits suicide. In a post-script, Kinsey explains that Tasha used a note Guy wrote to Kinsey as evidence of testamentary to ensure his share of the Malek millions goes to Peter and Winnie's church. The book ends with Kinsey's reconciling her grief at losing Guy, just as she once had to do with her deceased parents and aunt.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator who is hired to find the missing brother, who shares the inheritance of his late father with his brothers.\n\nReviews\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Major%22_John_Buchanan?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Major\" John Buchanan (born in January 12, 1759) was an American frontiersman and one of the founders of present-day Nashville, Tennessee. He is best known for defending his fort, Buchanan Station, from an attack by several hundred Native American Indians on September 30, 1792. The defense at Buchanan's Station saved early Nashville, which was unprepared after dismissing rumors of an incoming Indian onslaught. On their part, the Indians recoiled, splitting into small parties that caused considerable damage to outlying homesteads but abandoned the major attack on Nashville. Nor was any like invasion attempted again. The defense of Buchanan's Station not only spared Nashville, but raised the morale of the pioneers at a dark and difficult time, and was frequently recalled in the following decades as a symbol of the courage and determination of the founders of the state of Tennessee.\n\nOrigins\nMajor Buchanan's roots can be traced to Anselan O Kyan, the son of the King of Ulster Dermond O Kyan of Ireland and the founder of the Buchanan clan. Anselan fled Ireland and landed on the northern coast of Argyll, Scotland near The Lennox north of the present day city of Glasgow, around the year 1016. Anselan assisted Malcolm II of Scotland in repelling his old enemies, the Danes, on two different occasions. Anselan received a grant of land in the north of Scotland, East of Loch Lomond. The Buchanan name bears a unique Coat of Arms and specific war cry granted to Anselan. John Buchanan was the great-grandson of Thomas Buchanan, who left Scotland in 1702 as one of six brothers (John, William, George, Thomas, Samuel, and Alexander) and one sister to resettle in County Donegal, Ireland. John Buchanan and his wife, Jane Trimble, emigrated to America as among the earliest colonists in North America, initially settling in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Major John Buchanan was born in 1759.\n\nSettlement in Cumberland\nTwenty-year-old John Buchanan and his family arrived at the future Nashville during the unusually cold winter of 1779–1780, ahead of James Robertson's founding party according to several historians. After losing his brother Alexander at Ft. Nashborough's 1781 \"Battle of the Bluff,\" Buchanan wrote Nashville's first book, John Buchanan's Book of Arithmetic. After living approximately four years at Fort Nashborough, Buchanan and his family moved a few miles east and established Buchanan’s Station on Mill Creek, at today’s Elm Hill Pike and Massman Drive in Nashville. Around 1786, Buchanan married Margaret Kennedy, who died after giving birth to their first and only child, John Buchanan II, born on May 15, 1787. His second wife, Sarah Ridley, bore thirteen children: George, Alexander, Elizabeth, Samuel, William, Jane T., James B., Moses R., Sarah V., Charles B., Richard G., Henry R., and Nancy M. As G.R. McGee writes in A History of Tennessee from 1663 to 1905, “[i]n the summer of 1780 the Indians began to kill the settlers and hunters that they found alone or in small parties, and this was kept up all the season. There was no open attacks upon the settlements, but if a man went out to gather corn, to hunt, to feed his stock, or to visit a neighbor he was in constant danger of being shot by an Indian hidden away in a thicket or canebrake.\"\n\nAttack on Buchanan's Station\nOn September 30, 1792, during the height of the Cherokee–American wars, approximately twenty defenders at Buchanan's Station held off several hundred Native Americans seeking to destroy all the Cumberland settlements. Buchanan and his compatriots stopped them—without the loss of a single stationer—before they could move on to attack the remainder of area settlements. Nineteenth-century historian J.G.M. Ramsey called this victory \"a feat of bravery which has scarcely been surpassed in all the annals of border warfare.\" Buchanan's Station was located on Mill Creek and consisted of a few buildings surrounded by a picket stockade and a blockhouse at the front gate overlooking the creek some four miles south of the infant settlement of Nashville. For most of the 19th century, Buchanan's Station was widely remembered as a symbol of the determination that created the State of Tennessee. At the time, Nashville consisted of only about sixty families, and it was isolated in a hostile and threatening wilderness. Communications with the nearest settlements, Knoxville in eastern Tennessee and Natchez further south on the Mississippi, were long and precarious. Although the ultimate responsibility for the area had been transferred from North Carolina to the United States federal government in 1790, neither entity had the will or resources to offer the small outpost effective protection. Ranged against it were Native Americans, understandably aggrieved at the loss of traditional territory, and international powers. Threatened by the rise of the new American republic, Britain and Spain both encouraged Indian confederacies to resist its expansion and create a buffer between it and their own colonial possessions. North of the Ohio, the British saw Indians as an essential part of the defense of Canada, while Baron Carondelet, the governor of Spanish territory south of the 31st parallel and west of the Mississippi, armed the southern Indians and urged them to unite against the Americans. It was time, one Spanish correspondent wrote, to “place an obstacle to the rapid western progress of the Americans and raise a barrier between these enterprising people and the Spanish possessions.” In these circumstances the positions of isolated American pioneer settlements was unenviable, and in 1792 Bledsoe’s and Ziegler’s stations north of Nashville were overrun by parties of Indians smaller than the one that attacked Buchanan’s later in the year. The assault on Buchanan’s Station was not a simple raid, but an attempt to wipe out the Nashville settlements entirely, backed by Spanish arms and supplies secured in Pensacola. Over three hundred Lower Cherokees, Creeks, and Shawnees under the command of a mixed blood Cherokee leader named John Watts, advanced on Nashville from their towns on the lower Tennessee River. Supposing that the outlying station of Buchanan could be disposed of quickly, the Indians attempted a surprise attack at midnight. The station contained only a handful of defenders, some fifteen men, who manned the port-holes while their women and children—led by Buchanan's wife—molded bullets, reloaded muskets and rifles, and supplied sustenance. During a furious fight, the Indians attempted to storm the palisade and to set fire to the roof of the blockhouse, but they were repelled within two hours.\n\nSally Ridley Buchanan\nIt was during this nighttime \"Battle of Buchanan's Station\" that Buchanan's eighteen-year-old wife, Sarah (\"Sally\") Ridley Buchanan, in her ninth month of pregnancy with the first of their thirteen children, earned national fame. She encouraged the men, reassured the women and children, molded much-needed ammunition reportedly by melting down her dinnerware, and provided the voice of victory throughout the seemingly hopeless pandemonium. For her uncommon valor, she was known as the \"Heroine of Buchanan Station\" and biographer Elizabeth Ellet referred to her as “the Greatest Heroine of the West.” Sally was heralded in magazines and newspapers as well as listed in at least two national encyclopedias of biography (Appleton's and Herringshaw's).\n\nAdditional Information\n\n* History of Nashville, Tennessee\n\nReferences\n" .

Set in 1950, it was first produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre in March 1982 and made its premiere on Broadway on 4 May at the Lyceum Theatre, where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in South Africa during apartheid era, and depicts how institutionalized racism, bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was also similar to Hally's, as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called \"Master Harold\", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to. The play was initially banned from production in South Africa. It was the first of Fugard's plays to premiere outside of South Africa.\n\nPlot\nThe play recounts the long, rainy afternoon that Hally (\"Master Harold\") spends with Sam and Willie, two middle-aged African servants of his parents' household, in a tea shop owned by Hally's mother. Sam and Willie have cared for seventeen-year-old Hally his whole life. At the start of the play Sam and Willie are practising ballroom steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is quickly revealed as being the more worldly of the two. When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps. Hally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition. Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood, and has always treated Hally as his nephew/ward. Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood. And hopefully thereby, takes up those values and viewpoints of an adult; and a man, that Sam, has over the years lain down; and, that all men try to leave as their legacy of shepherding an adolescent boy into manhood. Willie, for his part, has always played the \"loyal black\"; who has always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) \"Master Harold\"; As if, as a man of forty-five, he was addressing a superior; even when Hally was six. The conversation between the three moves from Hally's school-work, to an intellectual discussion on \"A Man of Magnitude\", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a Boarding House. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word English composition. The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the ballroom dancing floor (\"a world without collisions\") is used as a transcendent metaphor for life. Almost immediately despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in World War II, to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged, and that the call must've been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father, is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home. Hally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger, and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him \"Master Harold\" and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry and both he and Willie are just short of attacking Hally, but they both understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain. There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up \"It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember,\" then asks Willie to lock up the tea shop, and walks out into the rain, as Sam mentions that the bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said \"Whites Only\" but Hally was too excited to notice it, and that he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. The play ends while Sam and Willie console each other by ballroom dancing together.\n\nCritical reception\nJohn Simon, writing for the New York magazine, was measured in his review: Fugard has now perfected his way of writing plays about the tragedy of apartheid; he avoids the spectacular horrors and concentrates instead on the subtle corrosion and corruption, on the crumbling of the spirit for which the cure would be heroic action that may not be forthcoming, which the blacks try to assuage with the salve of dreams, the whites with the cautery of oppression. — John Simon, \"'Two Harolds and no Medea.\" (May 17, 1982) Frank Rich of The New York Times praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: There may be two or three living playwrights in the world who can write as well as Athol Fugard, but I'm not sure that any of them has written a recent play that can match  'Master Harold' ... and the Boys. Mr. Fugard's drama - lyrical in design, shattering in impact - is likely to be an enduring part of the theater long after most of this Broadway season has turned to dust. — Frank Rich, \"'Master Harold,' Fugard's drama on the origin of hate.\" (May 5, 1982)\n\nCasting history\nThe principal casts of notable productions of Master Harold... and the Boys Ivanek left to make the film The Sender in 1982, which is why he was replaced by Price. The Afrikaans version was translated by Idil Sheard as Master Harold en die Boys.\n\nAdaptations\n(Main article: Master Harold...and the Boys (2010 film))\n\n\n1985 film\nFugard adapted the play for a television movie produced in 1985, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg with stars, Matthew Broderick, Zakes Mokae, and John Kani.\n\n2010 film\nA filmed version of the play was produced in South Africa in 2009 starring Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Finding Neverland) as Hally and Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Mission Impossible 1–3) as Sam.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Muslim_patrol%22_incidents_in_London?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "A group of vigilantes calling themselves \"Muslim patrols\" patrolled the streets in East London from 2013 to 2014. The individuals were young Sunni Muslim men, members of an organisation that called itself the \"Shariah Project\". Early in 2013, videos of their activities, filmed by members of the patrol, were uploaded online: these showed hooded members confronting passers-by and demanding that they behave in an Islamic way. They targeted prostitutes, people drinking alcohol, couples who were holding hands, women whom they considered to be dressed immodestly, and harassed others whom they perceived as being gay. Five men were arrested in January 2013 as part of an investigation into the gang. In December 2013, three of them pleaded guilty to affray, and were subsequently jailed. The Muslim East London Mosque community condemned the patrols as \"utterly unacceptable\"  In response to the attacks the nationalist organisation Britain First has established \"Christian Patrols\".\n\nOnline videos, 2013\nOne video uploaded to YouTube by the gang, \"The Truth About Saturday Night\", was viewed more than 42,000 times. In it, the gang confronted people, shouting \"this is a Muslim area\" at them. The hooded men are seen forcing people to empty their alcoholic drinks down drains, and instructing a group of women that \"they need to forbid themselves from dressing like this and exposing themselves outside the mosque\". A second video, beginning with a logo saying \"Islam will take over the world\", showed the gang shouting homophobic abuse at a man walking in Whitechapel. The gang shouted at a man who appeared to be wearing make-up that he is \"in a Muslim area dressed like a fag\" and must leave. One gang member orders the man: \"Get out of here quicker. You're dirty mate.\" After the victim says that he is a homosexual, he is repeatedly prompted to say that he is \"dirty\". Their last video featured the gang saying: \"We are coming to implement Islam upon your own necks. Muslim patrols can never be stopped\". The videos were removed from YouTube in January 2013 because they contravened the site’s policies on harassment, bullying and threatening behaviour. Scotland Yard investigated the videos and the Metropolitan Police stepped up patrols in East London. A police spokesman said they were in contact with \"local community leaders and influential people, local businesses and the local authority about the issue and what is being done\". Five men were later arrested.\n\nCondemnation\nThe East London Mosque condemned the patrols as \"utterly unacceptable and clearly designed to stoke tensions and sow discord.\"They said the mosque was \"committed to building co-operation and harmony between all communities in this borough.\" Gay rights group Stonewall said: \"This incident is yet another reminder of the homophobic abuse that gay people face all too often.\"\n\nOrigin of patrols\nThe arrested patrollers were members of The Shariah Project. The organisation's co-founder, Abu Rumaysah, told the press the arrested men would be welcomed back despite their convictions at the Central Criminal Court. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as \"strongly linked\" to Anjem Choudary's group Al-Muhajiroun. Several media reports have since identified the Sharia patrols as part of a network of followers of Anjem Choudary. Choudary himself has condoned the Sharia patrols, has spoken in public before several supporters known to take part in these patrols, including at meetings held early in 2014, and praised as \"commendable\" the actions of the convicted members of the Sharia patrol.\n\nConviction and sentencing\nThe Central Criminal Court heard evidence concerning incidents involving the patrol which took place in Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, and outside the East London Mosque where videos were made of members of the patrol harassing members of the public at night when the mosque was closed. The patrol targeted a heterosexual couple in Bethnal Green for holding hands, shouting at them to stop because they were in \"a Muslim area.\" Just weeks later, the patrol picked on five friends who were drinking in the street because it was \"Allah's land\"; 19-year-old Islamic convert Jordan Horner threatened to stab the men, while one of the patrol members shouted \"kill the non-believers\". Three of the patrol members were convicted in November, and were sentenced on 6 December 2013. Jordan Horner, who uses the Islamic name Jamaal Uddin, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour, and was sentenced to 68 weeks imprisonment. Thirty-six-year-old Ricardo MacFarlane who pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to one year for affray and two years for using threatening words and behaviour. 23-year-old Royal Barnes, who was awaiting further trial regarding offensive videos about Lee Rigby and therefore could not be named at the time, pleaded guilty and received a six-month sentence for affray. In February 2014 Horner, McFarlane and Barnes were given anti-social behaviour orders barring them from the activities that led to their conviction and from associating with Choudary.\n\nResponses\nMaajid Nawaz, himself a Muslim and the head of an anti-extremist organisation, the Quilliam Foundation, warned that Muslim patrols could become a \"lot more dangerous\", and if joined by jihadis, might even kill or maim people.A writer for the International Business Times suggested that these \"radical Muslim youths determined to impose their views of public conduct and morality\" felt alienated from what they consider a \"hostile and discriminatory outside society\", and have turned to their faith to forge a separate identity. In response to the \"Muslim Patrols\", the far-right organisation Britain First has established \"Christian Patrols\" in East London. The Christian Patrols supposedly ride through the area in \"armoured Landrover vehicles\" and have handed out literature marked with a red Christian cross. A Christian leader Rev. Alan Green, as well as a Muslim leader Dilowar Khan, have both condemned Christian and Muslim patrols.\n\nDocumentaries on London patrols\nIn April 2014 two news documentaries were produced about the ongoing Sharia patrols: their respective presenters, Lama Hasan of ABC News and Alex Miller of Vice News, each accompanied a patrol in action. Alex Miller, reflecting on the difference between the evidence presented by the Youtube videos and what he observed of the patrol he followed around Ilford, commented: \"this PR-friendly walk through the neighbourhood was pretty different from the country's first look at the Muslim patrols\". Interviewed by Alex Miller, Abu Rumaysah said: \"We don't recognise British law at all. We believe in Islam. We believe in Sharia. And that's what sets our parameters for right and wrong.\"\n\nSee also\n\n* \"Shariah Police\" incidents in Wuppertal, Germany (2014) \n* Islamic fundamentalism \n* Mishmeret Tzniyut \n* Moral police \n* Islamic religious police \n* Islamic Defenders Front\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* CNN - London's 'Muslim Patrol' aims to impose Sharia law in East London \n* The Shariah Project website \n* 'I feel like a stranger where I live’ The Daily Telegraph" .

The novel was a New York Times best-seller.\n\nPlot summary\nThe story takes place mainly in the small-town mountain community of Nota Lake, California (population 2,356, elevation 4,312), where Kinsey has inherited a client named Selma Newquist from her periodic boyfriend Robert Dietz. He is temporarily out of action back home in Carson City, where Kinsey has been taking care of him following knee surgery. Selma's brief is vague: she fears her husband Tom, a sheriff's officer who died of a heart attack a few weeks before, had something on his mind at the time of his death; and she wants Kinsey to find out what it was. With very little to go on, Kinsey finds the residents of the insular community are not forthcoming. She finds Tom was held in high respect, while reactions to Selma range from tolerance for Tom's sake to downright dislike. Tom's colleagues in the sheriff's department, including Tom's partner Rafer LaMott and brother Macon Newquist, close ranks around his memory, though their respective wives, as well as Selma's 25-year-old son by her first marriage, Brant, are slightly more friendly and helpful to Millhone, as is CHP officer James Tennyson, who found Tom's body. A frustrating search of Tom's home office reveals nothing more than some doodling and a list of phone numbers; but it seems someone is worried about what Kinsey might find when she is first threatened by a masked driver, then attacked in her temporary accommodation, the dismal Nota Lake Cabins run by Tom's elder sister Cecilia Boden. Retreating to Santa Teresa to lick her wounds (two dislocated fingers and a beaten-up jaw), Kinsey follows up leads from the phone numbers she found in Tom's office, from which she finds Tom was interested in the case of a petty criminal, Alfie Toth, whom he had traced to a hotel in Santa Teresa before Toth died in what might have been a murder or a bizarre suicide. Toth's unusual death has curious similarities to that of a prison associate of his, career-criminal, child-abuser, and rapist Pinkie Ritter, who died 5 years earlier but whose body only came to light near Nota Lake shortly before Toth was killed. Following up more of Tom's recent phone calls, Kinsey traces local sheriff's department officer Colleen Sellers, who had been in love with Tom, who reluctantly assists with information that Tom was suspicious that someone close to him was responsible for the deaths of both Toth and Ritter. When she also finds out that one of Ritter's daughters, Margaret, worked for Tom at the sheriff's department, Kinsey reluctantly realizes she has to return to Nota Lake to wrap up the case. Now enduring open hostility in the town and a sinister atmosphere of danger and unsure whom she can trust, Kinsey discovers that Rafer's daughter Barrett has had Tom's missing field notes since his death—but they are in code. Belatedly, Kinsey cracks the code and realizes that the threat comes not from one of Tom's colleagues, but his step-son, Brant, who had himself been sexually abused by Ritter, killed him in retaliation, and then killed witness Toth later when he found out through Tom's investigation where Toth was. It was the realization that Brant had committed murder, and that Brant had found Toth through him, that was causing Tom's anguish before his death. Despite being unwittingly drugged by Brant in a final showdown, Kinsey manages to subdue him, much to Selma's horror.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private detective who takes on a case from her sometime boyfriend, who is not in good shape to pursue it himself.\n\nReviews\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site \n* Grafton, Sue (1998). \"N\" is for Noose.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/%22Never_Again%22_Association?dbpv=2020-02&nif=context> <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#isString> "\"Never Again\" Association (Polish: Stowarzyszenie \"Nigdy Więcej\") is an independent anti-racism organization, based in Warsaw. The organization has its roots in an in-formal anti-Nazi youth group that was active since 1992, and was formally founded in 1996 at Bydgoszcz by . As of 2010, there were several hundred members in the organization, of which some 80% were in Poland and 20% were in other European countries. As of 2018, the organization is headed by Rafał Pankowski. \"Never Again's\" publications have been modeled after the British Searchlight publication, with which it cooperates. \"Never Again\" regularly cooperates with the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nPublications\nThe organization publishes, since 1994, the \"Never Again\" magazine. The magazine is focused on countering intolerance, fascism, racism and xenophobia. A 2009 cover story on \"Slavic Abuse\", by Marcin Kornak, described groups that committed to the pagan Rodzimowierstwo beliefs coupled with right-wing leanings. Kornak described in the article the far-right, fascist, appropriation of neo-paganism with roots in Jan Stachniuk's pre-WWII Zadruga movement. Kornak asserted that fascist neo-paganism sees the role of paganism as \"an ideological fist aimed the Judeo-Christian concept of charity, humility, ...\" saying this was a perversion of the original Slavic religion which certainly was not based on antisemitic complexes. Kornak's article elicited a response in Gniazdo periodical in which the writer noted that in his view Kornak's basic thesis was correct but complained that Kornak \"sees \"little Nazis\" almost everywhere\". The organization's Brown Book (Polish: „Brunatna Księga”), compiles xenophobic, racist, and anti-gay incidents.\n\nActivities\nIn 2003, \"Never Again\" organized a campaign with the slogan \"Let's Kick Racism out of the Stadiums\", imploring the Polish Football Association to act against racism in the sport. \"Never Again\" subsequently gave a presentation at a conference on stadium security organized by the football association. Among other endorsements, Poland's first black international player Emmanuel Olisadebe endorsed their work. In 2012, ahead of UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine, \"Never Again\" launched one of the most extensive anti-racist campaigns in football, as part of the Fare network in which \"Never Again\" is a co-founder. In 2017, \"Never Again's\" Rafał Pankowski condemned the sale in the Parliament of Poland of \"lucky Jew\" figurines which depict Jews with money, as \"deeply rooted in negative stereotypes\". Following Pankowski's condemnation, the figurines were removed from sale. In 2018, after over a decade of lobbying, \"Never Again\" convinced the Allegro site to halt sales of item bearing Nazi symbols, A team of \"Never Again\" volunteers reported sales of over 1,000 such auctions to Allegro which then took them down. While such items are illegal in Poland and prohibited by Allegro's terms of use, prior to \"Never Again's\" activities the sale of such items on Allegro were widespread.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website" .

It was released on the 9th May 2005 and features appearances by Geneviève Castrée and Jason Wall.\n\nRecording and Release\nThe album was recorded in Nowhere, Anacortes from October 19th, 2004 to January 30th, 2005, the mixing was done at The Unknown studio in Anacortes, it was mastered by T. Stollenwerk. The album was initially released in 2005 under the name \"ELV005\". The album was re-released in 2015 under the name “ELV037”. The re-release was re-mixed, re-mastered, and re-pressed with redesigned jackets. Physical versions of the album come with a very large album fold-out with one side showing a large illustration, and the other filled with extensive footnotes and explanations of the songs, with references, clippings, and photos.\n\nThe Drums from \"No Flashlight\" by Mt. Eerie\nThe drum tracks from this album were later released separately as The Drums from \"No Flashlight\" by Mt. Eerie, with the band claiming: \"We felt the drums on 'No Flashlight' sounded good enough to listen to by themselves.\"\n\nReception\n\"No Flashlight\": Songs of the Fulfilled Night received generally positive reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 72 based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". In a positive review Dom Sinacola of CokeMachineGlow wrote that \"No Flashlight doesn’t sound much like a lullaby worth revisiting each night. Amazingly, Mount Eerie still crafts a series of passages that breathes, and walks, and enjoys a generous restraint.\" Zac Pennington and Adam Gnade of Portland Mercury wrote that \"After releasing three consecutive records of masterfully progressive conceptual vision, Elverum's latest (as its title suggests) seems to be more about a search for something than a destination\", \"And though at times frustrating, it's the questions that keep me consistently coming back to No Flashlight. So Phil: what does Mount Eerie mean, anyway?\" a review by Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that \"Phil is obviously trying to communicate a particular message with little abstraction. He's taking this opportunity to share with us something special to him, and he's doing so in the most honest way he can.\" Elizabeth Newton of The Quietus praised the album writing that \"Fluctuations in Elverum's persona, self-consciously sullen and wrung from second thoughts, ultimately add up to a stable whole because his tone remains so thoroughly distinctive\" and that \"Now more than ever, this music is laced with its maker's insistent worldview at every turn, and it's better for it.\" A mixed review by Stylus wrote that \"because Elvrum’s philosophy is a rather muddled one (even with a surfeit explanation bordering on the absurd), it tends to take away from the album at key moments. Musical highlights like the beautifully hummed “How?” are weighed down by Elvrum’s insistence on calling the visible world “the romance” or the unfortunate lyric “Because the pupil of my eye is a hole / There’s no Inside and there’s no Out / The world is in me and I am in the world” from the shimmering “No Inside, No Out.”\" in a negative review, Sam Ubl of Pitchfork said that \"Demanding listener input-- as Elverum does here by not-so-subtly inviting us to ponder him-- isn't a bad thing. But courting ears with such esoteric hooey is disingenuous and annoying\" and that \"he now makes boring music that is premised on his persona and the explanation thereof\"\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Phil Elverum.\n\nReferences\n" .

It was recorded at two shows (*Wembley Arena, December 2, 1988 and **Manchester Apollo, March 15, 1990) for the BBC and was broadcast live by BBC Radio One. These recordings were compiled by Wayne Hussey and Joe Gibb. In 2008 all tracks, except for #6, #8 and #9, and more from both concerts were released as part of the Live at the BBC boxset. The Eskimo in the title refers to an early name for the die-hard Mission fans who would follow them around the world on tour.

(stylized as \"O\"-正.反.合.), sometimes referred to as \"O\"-Union or just O, is the third Korean studio album (fourth overall) by South Korean pop group TVXQ, released on September 29, 2006 by S.M. Entertainment. In a year when Korean music sales had slumped, it was the highest selling album in South Korea in 2006 and won the group several prominent awards in South Korea. The album stayed charted within the top 50 throughout 2007. By 2014, it sold over 475,000 copies. The album's name \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap, literally translated to \"O\"-Justice.Opposition.Solution, is based on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's theory of thesis, antithesis, synthesis. The album's mononymous lead single has lyrics that regard global conflicts with a plea for peace and resistance. The album has a balance of fast tempo songs and ballads.\n\nVersions and repackaging\nThe album was released in 4 different versions and packaging, versions A and B, C and D. Versions A and B promote the title song \"\"\"O\"-正.反.合.\", while versions C and D promote the fantasy theme of the song \"Balloons\" and contain new songs and a DVD in each. The initial versions of the album with the original track listing was released in CD and cassette formats. For the version D, the label company did a unique box packaging, with special deck of cards with members' pictures wearing costumes included with the CD and DVD specials. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, the album was released under the names \"O\"-Jing.Fan.Hap. and \"O\"-Zheng.Fan.He. respectively, while in Japan the name of the album is \"O\"-Sei.Han.Go.. The Japanese release does not contain the repackaged versions that are available in the Korean release.\n\nSingles\n\n\n\"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap\nThe lead single is a fast-tempo fusion of rock, hip hop, and electronic trance. The music video took several days to complete as its footage was shot in several different countries. U-Know Yunho's footage was shot in Japan, Micky Yoochun's and Max Changmin's in Prague, Hero Jaejoong's in Thailand, and Xiah Junsu's in South Korea. The music video showcases intense and unique dance choreography with stylized outfits.\n\nBalloons\nIn drastic contrast to the lead single, \"Balloons\" (Pungseon in Korean) is a bubbly song that features TVXQ members in animal costumes, made to directly appeal to the younger generation, as well as older generations familiar with the original \"Balloons\" by Five Fingers (an old Korean band). The lyrics talk about innocent childhood dreams and memories and how people tend to forget the importance of those dreams as they grow older. In the lyrics, \"yellow balloons\" line was changed to \"red balloons\" to coordinate with the colour that represents TVXQ's fanbase Cassiopeia.\n\nPerformances\nIn three short months after the album's release, TVXQ were invited to perform on many stages of music shows, award shows, and concerts. TVXQ performed their third album's songs a few times in 2007 as well, since a fourth Korean album had not been released.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nVersion A\n\n\nVersion B\n\n\nVersion C\n\n\nVersion D\n\n\nJapanese version\n\n\nRelease history\n\n\nCharts and sales\n\n\nKorean albums & singles chart\n\n\nKorea Top 100 Yearly Chart\n\n\nReferences\n" .

It consists of one song lasting 46 minutes in its stereo mix and 42 minutes in its surround sound mix. The release's liner notes state that the piece is an exploration of band leader Greg Jarvis's synesthesia and was conceived as a piece of absolute music (music with no specific subject matter). It consists of rehearsed improvisations performed with-in a 12 part fixed song structure, recorded in one take at the end of a 9000 km tour. In a 2010 interview with Spinner, Jarvis said that \"O\" was also designed to explore music's unique capabilities as an art form that unfolds over time. The album was produced by Jarvis with recording taking place in Toronto with engineer Jon Drew (Stars, Fucked Up). It was mixed in Manchester by Jarvis and fellow synesthete Tom Knott of The Earlies. \"O\" was initially released by Optical Sounds on a double sided CD / DVD disc, coupled with a concert film, Live At The Music Gallery. The Flowers Of Hell performed \"O\" live as a seated 12 piece with Jarvis conducting at Toronto's Yonge-Dundas Square as the closing act of the 2011 Intersection Festival of experimental and new classical music.\n\nCritical reception\n\"O\" received favourable ratings from media sources including All Music (4/5), Drowned In Sound (7/10), and Eye Weekly (8/10).

The novel’s plot has its roots in the Vietnam War, and features information about Kinsey’s previously unnamed first husband, Mickey, and their brief marriage 14 years before. There is no interaction between them in the story because Mickey is in a coma throughout the novel's action.\n\nPlot summary\nKinsey’s curiosity is roused when she receives a call from a man who has bought some of her possessions at an auction of defaulted storage locker items. She recognizes the box as stuff which she left in the possession of her former husband, Michael Magruder – whom she met and married during her time on the Santa Teresa Police Force at the age of 21. She walked out after eight months in 1972. Mickey had asked her to give him a false alibi when he was accused of violence against a recently returned Vietnam veteran Benny Quintero, who later died. Kinsey refused to lie, assuming his guilt, and left him. As well as high school and police academy memories, she finds in the box a letter written to her 14 years before, shortly after she left Mickey, which never reached her. It is from Dixie Hightower, barmaid at an old haunt from that era called the Honky-Tonk, saying that Mickey was with her the night he was accused of killing Benny. While shocked to find out her husband was cheating, Kinsey realises she did Mickey an injustice thinking he killed Benny and sets out to find out what has happened to him. The trail leads her to Shack, a former colleague of Mickey’s, and to Tim Litenberg, the son of another colleague, who is running the Honky-Tonk, as well as to Dixie herself, living in new-found luxury with her Vietnam vet husband Eric. Kinsey finds out Mickey had been frequenting the Honky-Tonk and is suspicious of his motives, sensing that he had uncovered some sort of illegal activity. She also contacts Mark Bethel, Mickey’s lawyer on the Quintero manslaughter charge, another veteran now running for political office. Two LAPD officers shock Kinsey with the news that Mickey is in a coma, having been shot with a gun registered to her, a present from Mickey she abandoned along with him. She is disconcerted to find this puts her high on the suspect list, especially since her assurances that she hasn’t spoken to Mickey in years are belied by a record of a 30-minute call from Mickey’s number to her apartment in recent weeks. Illegally breaking into Mickey’s apartment in search of answers, Kinsey finds a stash of weapons, false IDs, and evidence of a trip Mickey made to Louisville, Kentucky, but her search is interrupted by a biker called Carlin Duffy, looking for Mickey, and who has been a frequent visitor in recent months according to Mickey’s neighbor Wary Beason. Duffy, a habitual criminal, turns out to be Benny Quintero’s half brother, and like his brother, hails originally from Louisville. Clearly he and Mickey shared an interest in finding the truth about Benny’s death. From Duffy, Kinsey learns that Mickey was interested in Benny’s connections to a young Louisville journalist called Duncan Oaks, who was killed in Vietnam. Benny had Duncan’s press pass and dog tags, which Duffy passed to Mickey, and which Kinsey assumes have been stolen from Mickey’ s apartment, though she later find she has them herself, sewn into a jacket of Mickey’s she took from the apartment as a souvenir. Kinsey follows Mickey’s trail to Louisville. She discovers that Oaks was injured in Vietnam but disappeared in transit for medical treatment, and also that he was a classmate of Mark Bethel’s wife Laddie. She deduces that Duncan and Laddie had some sort of affair, giving Mark Bethel a motive for Duncan’s disappearance in Vietnam. Back in Santa Teresa, the LAPD detectives reappear and confirm they have traced Bethel’s fingerprints in Mickey’s apartment, searching for the missing press pass, and suspect him of shooting Mickey. They compare notes and conclude that Bethel must have pushed Oaks out of the medical helicopter, witnessed by Benny Quintero. When Quintero headed for California after the war and presumably tried to blackmail Bethel, Bethel killed him and set Mickey up to take the rap. Years later when Mickey finally uncovered the truth, Bethel shot him, implicating Kinsey. Kinsey is reluctantly persuaded by the detectives to attempt to trap Bethel into a confession, an operation which goes badly wrong, and she ends up a target. However Duffy, now understanding Bethel to be the one responsible for his brother’s death, decapitates Bethel with a digger, saving Kinsey. Meanwhile, Kinsey has uncovered the truth at the Honky-Tonk: it is being used to manufacture fake IDs, as Mickey had discovered. He reports the scam, and having exonerated Mickey on all fronts, is with him when he dies without regaining consciousness.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Kinsey Millhone: Private investigator who decides to follow up the story of her first husband, who she left after eight months of marriage because she thought he asked her to do something illegal.\n\nReviews\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site" .

Containing the pitch-classes 014589 (C, C♯, E, F, G♯, A) it is given Forte number 6-20 in Allen Forte's taxonomic system. The primary form of the tone row used in the Ode allows the triads of G minor, E♭ minor, and B minor to easily appear. The \"Ode-to-Napoleon\" hexachord is the six-member set-class with the highest number of interval classes 3 and 4 yet lacks 2s and 6s. 6-20 maps onto itself under transposition three times (@0,4,8) and under inversion three times (@1,4,9) (six degrees of symmetry), allowing only four distinct forms, one form overlapping with another by way of an augmented triad or not at all, and two augmented triads exhaust the set as do six minor and major triads with roots along the augmented triad. Its only five-note subset is  (0,1,4,5,8), the complement of which is  (0,1,2,4,5,8,9), the only superset of 6-20. The only more redundant hexachord is 6-35. It is also Ernő Lendvai's \"1:3 Model\" scale and one of Milton Babbitt's six all-combinatorial hexachord \"source sets\". The hexachord has been used by composers including Bruno Maderna and Luigi Nono, such as in Nono's  sulla serie dell'op. 41 di Arnold Schönberg (1950), Webern's Concerto Op. 24, Schoenberg's  Op. 29 (1926), Babbitt's Composition for Twelve Instruments (1948) and Composition for Four Instruments (1948) third and fourth movements. The hexachord has also been used by Alexander Scriabin and Béla Bartók but is not featured in the music of Igor Stravinsky. It is used combinatorially in Schoenberg's Suite: P3: E♭ G  F♯ B♭ D  B // C  A  A♭ E  F  D♭I8: G♯ E  F  D♭ A  C // B  D  E♭ G  F♯ B♭ Note that its complement is also 6-20.\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Baker, James M.
